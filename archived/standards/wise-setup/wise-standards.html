     As a part of Branding within SSW, all the product installations should have a standard
        layout. There is no point having one installation that has the SSW Logo and the
        web site if none of the others follow suit.
    </p>
<p>
     The idea is that each product when the first installation is created should have
        several items filled out by the programmer working on the product. Below is a list
        of the current items that are required in the product installations.
    </p>
<p>
<a href="WiseScript/SSW.msi">
      This
     </a>
     is a standard WISE Installation Script file
        (to make an .msi). You will need WISE for Windows Installer to open it.

<p>
       To setup template for the Wise Installer for Windows:
      </p>
<ol>
<li>
        Copy SSWWindowsApplications.msi
        <br/>
        from
        <a href="WiseScript/SSW.msi">
         www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/WiseSetup/WiseScript/SSW.msi
        </a>
<br/>
        to you application's "Setup" folder.
        <br/>
<br/>
        This template will be used in conjunction with the Visual Build Pro script which
                        will be used to build release packages.
        <br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
        Now we can create new setup with the standard template
        <br/>
        Right-click the SSW.msi and choose "Edit in Wise editor".
        <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>
         Figure: Open file using the Wise editor.
        </b>
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
        Go to the "File" Menu and "Save As...", then choose "Installer
                        Projects (*.wsi)" from the type combo as shown below, then name the file after
                        your solution file's name.
        <br/>
<br/>

        This will prevent developers from keeping a template on their local drive rather
                        than always getting the latest template.

<h2>
<a name="ProductCode">
</a>
       Copy the Product Code Across
      </h2>
<p>
       This is very important if you are creating a new package for an existing product. 
                You also need to check the codes in the package that you get from Source Safe to ensure that they're the same as the previous released version.
       <br/>
       If you do not copy the Product Code across from the old WSI file, your new package
                will not be able to detect versions created with old Wise packages and will not
                uninstall these older versions.
      </p>
<p>
       Copying the Product Code:
      </p>
<ol>
<li>
        Open the old WSI file.
       </li>
<li>
        Select the Setup Editor.
       </li>
<li>
        Click the Product Tab.
       </li>
<li>
        Select Properties from the tree view.
       </li>
<li>
        Copy the Product Code value.
       </li>
<li>
        Paste the Product Code into your new WSI file.
       </li>
<li>
        Repeat the process for the UpgradeCode.
       </li>
<li>
        Repeat the process for the PackageCode (which is found in the Summary section).

       These files will automatically be removed on uninstall because Wise keeps a link
                to each file that has been added above. However, if there are files that have been
                added to the directory
       <i>
        after
       </i>
       the installation process, Wise will not have
                the list of these files to remove. Therefore the RemoveFile operation needs to be

       Remove Unnecessary System Searches

<p>
       The Wise Template includes all the possible system searches for all SSW's products.
                This makes it easier to remove the registry key searches that specific applications
                do not need, rather than adding them individually and having to spend those extra
                few minutes to find the registry keys required per application.
      </p>
<p>
       If the system searches are not removed, the first dialog of the wizard takes a long
                time to load.

<h2>
<a name="AssemblyDependency">
</a>
       Remove Assembly Dependency Check
      </h2>
<p>
       Make sure the Wise File does not scan for dependencies.
       <br/>
       This makes sure that the Build Script does not include the dependencies (especially
                moving dll's into the GAC of the destination machine), which was not initially specified.
      </p>
<p>
       The reason why we turn the scanning for dependencies off is for the following:
      </p>
<ul>
<li>
        Usually the assemblies that wise wants to add, are the ones that the developer doesn't
                    want to add. When you tell it no it asks for every subsequent build.
       </li>
<li>
        The additional scanning takes time, and sometimes a lot of time.
       </li>
<li>
        Not being able to build wise and just walk away and come back later the dialog demands
                    user interference.
        <br/>
        eg. In Smart Salary, because the job was an upsize job there was a lot of interop
                    libraries that WISE insisted that we must have. Clicking through 10+ screens to
                    ignore the add-reference dialog got really tedious.
       </li>
<li>
        The build script will automatically add them when running in silent mode.
       </li>
</ul>
<p>
       Trade off:
       <br/>
        
      </p>
<ul>
<li>
        Obviously, if WISE doesn't scan for dependencies, then when you add new components,
                        you may forget to add them to your setup project. However, if you forgot to add
                        a component to setup, this is usually very quickly caught in testing the application,
                        and the fix is relatively simple as well. This simple trade off is worth all the
                        hassle of having it on.
       </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
        Steps to remove Assembly Dependency scanning:
      </p>
<ol>
<li>
        Goto Tools -&gt; Options.

<li>
        Make sure the "Never Scan Dependencies" is selected in the "Scan

<li>
        Make sure the "Rescan assembly dependencies on compile" and "Rescan
                    assembly attributes on compile" are both unchecked.
       </li>
<li>
        You can also uncheck the "Rescan for COM interop registry keys on compile",
                    and select ".Net Application" in the drop down.

                and update the prompt message in 'Property' table. The reason for this is because
                our Visual Build will include the product version in our product name, so if you
                don't do this, the prompt message will be very confusing.

       Some special features for Vista
      </h2>
      Vista is totally different from other OS of Microsoft. It has special system folder architecture and security mechanism.
      <br/>
      Wise 7 can support Vista very well. There are some special features designed for Vista. If you want to build the product compliant with Vista, please take care of the following settings.
      <ol>
<li>
        "AllUsers" is a hidden property in the property table, setup editor. Its default value is 0 - that means the software will be installed per user.
        <br/>
        This value should be set to 2 - the files (e.g. the shortcuts) will be installed according to user access level:
        <br/>
        for standard user access privileges, the files are stored in folders under the user's personal profile;
        <br/>
        for administrator access privileges, the files are stored in folders under "All Users" profile. (in Vista, it is "ProgramData" folder)
        <br/>
<dl>
<dt>
<img src="/history/standards/wise-setup/images/vista-all-users.jpg"/>
</dt>
<dd>
          Figure: Set the "ALLUSERS" property
         </dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
        In "Windows Installer Options", you can set to enable/disable the UAC (User Account Control) during the installation. This configuration does not mean you can open or close UAC in Vista.
        <br/>
        In fact, enable this will make the installer to try to elevate privilege  while it is writing files to protected area.
        <br/>
        e.g. When you try to do a per machine installation, you will need to write files to "ProgramData" folder, or add registry keys to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE". If you do not enable this, the installation process will fail because you may not have administrator privileges to do so.

<li>
        If you want to create new template by Wise 7, be careful of "Create a Vista Standard User Installation" checkbox. Enable this will make the installation only has standard user access privileges and can't operate on any protected files.

       Do you have a 'Systems Requirements' screen when
                installing a product?
      </h2>
<p>
       Installing a product should be easy and fuss free! If your product requires other
                programs to be installed, for example the Microsoft .NET Framework, I find it is
                best to include a 'Systems Requirements' screen where the user can click the
                links provided and install the required programs and then continue with the installation
                of your product. If your installation exits prematurely due to not having the required
                programs installed, the user can get frustrated - make life easy for them!

</p>
<p>
       However, sometime it's very hard to detect the required software in user environment,
                eg. a database server on the network. In such cases, you should still include the
                required software on other screen to warn your user. At least let them know what
                they are going to need to run your application.
