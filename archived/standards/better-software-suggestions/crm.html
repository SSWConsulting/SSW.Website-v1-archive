<h2>
<a name="Cheap-license">
</a>
       Enable a super cheap license (say $1 month per user) when using CRM as an XRM platform (if hosted on Azure)
      </h2>
<p>
       I get the value of CRM when a customer uses it out of the box (you get a full Customer Relationship solution to improve your sales)... But what about when you are using it to build a custom solution?
      </p>
<p>
       I don't think many developers know that using CRM (as xRM) gives you a nice GUI for creating tables, that automatically give you a basic editing form and services to program against.
      </p>
<p>
       Make it easy for developers in VS to choose to build a solution on either:
      </p>
<ul>
<li>
        ASP.NET and SQL Server
       </li>
<li>
        ASP.NET and xRM on Azure (empty $1 per month per user)
       </li>
<li>
        ASP.NET and CRM on Azure (everything - normal $100 per month per user)
       </li>
</ul>
<p>
       My logic is that Microsoft wants Azure to be huge, and this is a step in that direction.

<h2>
<a name="UserExperience">
</a>
       User Experience - Help me have a consistent User Experience with SharePoint, CRM and TFSWA Web UI
      </h2>
<p>
       Make Dynamics CRM and SharePoint and TFS (Web Access) consistent to end users. Please.
      </p>
<p>
       Remember the early days of Microsoft Office when an end user got used to Excel, and we could show them that the switch from WordPerfect to Word would be fine.
      </p>
<p>
       e.g. "See Mary, it has the same File Menu and look at the toolbar, and the Tools | Options is the same place."
      </p>
<p>
       Well today I have bosses who love SharePoint, but I get no loyalty from them or
                their end users, when evaluating CRM4 vs Salesforce for their CRM. There is no loyalty
                because knowing SharePoint, does not help you know CRM.
      </p>
<p>
       The first thing they want to do is change a few things... add a few fields.... so
                start with making the customizing consistent...
      </p>
<p>
       e.g.
      </p>
<ol>
<li>
        Modifying a list in SharePoint
       </li>
<li>
        Modifying an entity in MS CRM
       </li>
<li>
        Modifying a work item in TFS
       </li>
</ol>
<p>
       Should all be the same experience.
      </p>
<p>
       For a gold star, we need to take more inspiration from Facebook. It is the standard UI.
      </p>
<p>
       I want to sign in to each of those 3 portals (see red icon I am used to seeing at the top now) and see if I have stuff that has happened while I was away.
      </p>
<p>
       e.g.
      </p>
<ol>
<li>
        In SharePoint someone made a comment about one of my documents
       </li>
<li>
        In CRM someone made a comment about one of the customers I am the Account Manager of
       </li>
<li>
        In TFS someone made a comment about one of the work items I authored.
       </li>
</ol>
</li>

       User Story: As a CRM power user, I want to change the background color of the Test Organization to Blue, so that users don't enter a lot of data into the test CRM server by mistake.
      </p>
<p>
       In CRM 2011, power users should be able to edit CSS on their CRM Website and this CSS should be per organization instead of per CRM web application.
      </p>
<p>
       In addition you should provide 4 out of the box templates for

<p>
       Tip #1: If I know how to do this in SharePoint, it should be the same for CRM. Right?
       <br/>
       So I would love to see it be consistent with the SharePoint experience (it uses the click once app, SharePoint Designer)

       Please compile CRM 2011 in .NET 4 - then I can use System.Web.Routing and do it myself.

<p>
       URL in CRM is hard to understand, for example:
      </p>
<dl class="badCode">

</dt>
<dd>
        Figure: Bad URL - it's not clear and easy to remember
       </dd>
</dl>
<p>
       It looks much better if the URL changes to:
      </p>
<dl class="goodCode">
<dt>
<pre>http://CRMServer/SSW/<span style="background-color: yellow;">Contacts/edit.aspx</span>?id={1F914A6F-C320-DD11-926D-00155D012229}</pre>

<p>
       The web application is not responsive enough when your whole job is to use it all day long.
      </p>
<p>
       Remember OWA is great, but most people choose to use Outlook all day long.
      </p>
<p>
       Experienced Sales Force users say that they find CRM slower to use. I believe this is because they use more AJAX/jQuery
       <br/>
       Strive to use as much AJAX as Facebook.
      </p>
<p>
       Tip #1: The Outlook Toolbar is OK, but needs an alternative
      </p>
<p>
       Tip #2: Need offline support

       After the CRM Outlook Client is installed, you will find that emails will sit in your Outbox without a send date (they change from italics to non-italics). This happens whenever you navigate to the outbox folder in Outlook and an item is selected.

       Currently, CRM only allows making address single line which is not appropriate, because address might contain much information that one line is not enough. It's much better to support both single line and multi-line for users to input their addresses.

<p>
       CRM should be the same as Outlook? Or as a minimum, give us an option in Customization to have "have all addresses on 1 multiple line field".
       <br/>
       Tips:
      </p>
<ol>
<li>
        You can change this easily - by making Address 2 and Address 3 invisible and make Address 1 multi-line.
       </li>
<li>
        If you hate how CRM deals with addresses, then fill all addresses in Outlook - it does synchronize back to CRM.

<p>
       CRM 4's email template needs to give an option to use a HTML file. This .html file would be used for the email body, because for professional newsletters you need to tweak the actual HTML.
      </p>
<p>
       For example, you need to check that your newsletter will be rendered nicely in Gmail - this means tweaking HTML manually

<p>
       CRM 4.0 provides an Outlook add-in which enables users to access and modify CRM data via Outlook. However there is no add-in to integrate Outlook Web Access with CRM 4.0. This means that:
      </p>
<ul>
<li>
        Any changes to appointments, tasks, email... being made via Outlook Web Access won't be synchronized with CRM data.
       </li>
<li>
        Since CRM 4.0 Outlook add-in only works with default profile. You cannot use CRM 4.0 via Outlook as another user until you log off that computer and sign in as another user.

       Improvements for the service calendar

<ol>
       The service calendar is a great way to schedule resources and keep track of what everyone is working on, however, there are a couple of things that would make it even more usable:
       <li>
        The Resources should be able to be grouped by site or employee type as default (instead of having to manually sort each time)
       </li>
<li>
        You should be able to select a default type and view (instead of having to navigate to it each time)
       </li>
<li>
        Weekends should not be displayed if they're empty, only if there's something scheduled on them
       </li>
</ol>

<p>
       This causes CRM to disconnect and for Outlook to freeze when connecting. CRM should have a proper threading model in its application so it does not make the user wait for extended periods of time.

<p>
       In Outlook 2010 with the CRM Add-in a service activity can be synchronized to your calendar. Great.  But when you double click it, it opens in the CRM web application.
       <br/>
       This should open as an appointment natively in the Outlook client, rather than just a short-cut.  It should only open the CRM service activity if we click "View in CRM".
