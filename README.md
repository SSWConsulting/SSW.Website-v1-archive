# SSW Website v1 Progress Tracking Repo

As per https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Website/issues/1263, we need a way to track the progress for which pages have been migrated to the v3 website. 

This repository serves as a tracker of which pages have been migrated, we will zz each page that we have migrated to the v3 Next.js site.

We are not zzing pages on the original repo because we want those pages to stay live so we can compare the new pages with them.

v1 site - https://dev.azure.com/ssw2/ssw.website   
bypass frontdoor (to see old pages) - https://prod.ssw.com.au/

## Tasks
- [ ] Turn off the v1 website's server 
- [ ] Remove this repo once all pages have been migrated to v3
