# SSW Website v1 Progress Tracking Repo

As per https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Website/issues/1263, we need a way to track the progress for which pages have been migrated to the v3 website. 

This repository serves as a tracker of which pages have been migrated, we will zz each page that we have migrated to the v3 Next.js site.

## Tasks
- [ ] Turn off the v1 website's server 
- [ ] Remove this repo once all pages have been migrated to v3
