        Moving this into a dropdown menu would make the home page cleaner... and this info would be available on all pages - not only when you are on the home page.

<ul>
<li>
         The web has meant that navigation is now expected at the top of a form. So I would move it to the top left of the white popup form
        </li>

         Also in this case an icon would be better than text

<p>
        I am only referring here to the 'out of the box' experience...

<p>
        I understand some people will put spaces in their own names.

        Allow me to rename a team and keep the links working
       </h2>
<p>
        I can rename a team (e.g. from the auto-generated "My Team" into something more meaningful).
       </p>
<p>
        However this means that all links are invalid and if users are already working with the backlog items, then they will get ugly errors.

</dl>
<p>
        That is a nice error message... well as nice I have seen for a while... but the goal should be to remove this error message altogether.
       </p>
<p>
        I would like to see this happen by adding in an entry into Tools | Options … auto populate it with:
       </p>
<h4>
        Additional URLs
       </h4>
<table class="clsSSWTable" width="50%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>
           Name
          </th>
<th>
           Description
          </th>
<th>
            
          </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
           [ NorthindOldName ]
          </td>
<td>
           [ (auto added from Rename) ]
          </td>

           [  delete  ]

</table>
<p>
        Obviously you would not be able to name a project to one that is used (e.g. the old name NorthwindOldName) until they had removed this record.

        In the CMS Orchard, modules are great. They can:
       </p>
<ul>
<li>
         be additional fields or functionality to existing features
        </li>
<li>
         be a widget (that you can add to various zones and layers)
        </li>
<li>
         create a new administration menu option with all kinds of wonderful new features
        </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
         So the possibilities for devs are pretty endless.
        </strong>
</p>
<p>
        Basic Orchard CMS website owner with no development skills can experience:
       </p>
<ul>
<li>
         a wonderful array of modules via the Gallery
        </li>
<li>
         a simple Gallery where they download, install, and enable a module with only 2 clicks
        </li>
<li>
         an ever growing list of modules that keeps growing and growing as developers create more
        </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
         The community does the work. Awesome.

        But even better... I expect that I could define this at a global field level. Yes I know this is formatting, but I think formatting should be included in the global field level.

<p>
        Even better isolate it out into a skin/theme file... Then I could develop a cool one. Examples:

        It is easy when the Sprint Retrospective time comes, to forget some of the events that have caused problems during the Sprint. Therefore people bring up things that they recall e.g things that happened in the last day or two.
       </p>
<p>
        A solution is to have a place to add the notes as you go. Currently there is no place to store notes from the Sprint that we can use as part of our retrospective.

        Note: Even a link to a SharePoint wiki would do (not ideal)
