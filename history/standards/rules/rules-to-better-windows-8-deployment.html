<p>
      At SSW we buy new computers as we need them – developers choose what they like e.g. Dell, HP, IBM or even the MacBook Pro with the dual boot that makes the designers happy!
     </p>
<p>
      Choice is good, however it does have its drawbacks; particularly when it comes to operating system deployments. In the past, each developer has had to build their environment each time they get a new PC or format from scratch because most deployment systems (such as Norton Ghost) are hardware specific. Depending on how much software a developer need to install, the time would range from a few hours to a couple of days.
      <br/>
      With the latest set of administration tools deployed with Microsoft Windows 8 we finally have a nice solution to deploying our operating environments.
     </p>
<p>
      We choose to implement Microsoft's new Business Desktop Deployment (BDD) solution and boy it deploys Windows 8 images quickly. The images include not just the OS, but all our standard applications.
     </p>
<p>
      As a result, unattended deployment time takes on average 45 mins. This includes the format! We were impressed and this
      <strong>
       one feature
      </strong>
      has saved us significant time and money.
      <br/>
      We've learnt a lot in the process, and I’m sure you’ll find the new Rules to Better Windows 8 Deployment valuable. These rules aim to help you prepare your deployment of Microsoft Windows 8 across your small to medium sized organization.
      <br/>

        Do you ensure you have a computer with the recommended specifications before upgrading to Windows 8?
       </h2>
<p>
        Before you consider installing a version of Windows 8, you should make sure that all of your third party devices work fine with the operating system. Third party devices include video cards, mp3 players, smartphones, displays or networking equipment.
       </p>
<p>
        You might end up with a system that is incompatible with some of the devices that you connect to the PC regularly or at least from time to time. The Compatibility Center for Windows 8 has been created to aid users in finding out if their hardware is compatible with Microsoft’s upcoming operating system.
       </p>
<p>
        The compatibility center is only available online at the moment, with the likelihood that Microsoft will release a software version that runs on previous operating systems to simplify things for interested users. For now, you have to go to the web service’s site and use it to find your devices and their compatibility status.

        Do you know whether to upgrade or reformat?
       </h2>
<p>
        When you're installing a new OS on your PC it's always a dilemma as to whether to go the whole hog and reformat your hard drive or take the upgrade path into the new system. Upgrading is nice because there is no need to install all your programs again. The problem is all the old junk stays around.
       </p>
<p>
        At SSW always go for a fresh start. We've already found a number of programs will not work in Windows 8. Besides, a nice, clean C: drive to go with your new, nice, clean operating system is always a big plus. Just be sure to follow your organization's backup standards carefully!
       </p>
<p>
<strong>
         Note:
        </strong>
        For individuals looking to upgrade to Windows 8, the upgrade process is exactly the same as that for Windows 7.
       </p>
<p>
<strong>
         Note:
        </strong>
        If you intend to follow an
        <a href="/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWindows8Deployment.aspx#DeployingWindows7">
         automated deployment
        </a>
        then you will be forced to reformat.
       </p>

<h2>
<a name="DeployingWindows7">
</a>
        Do you know the best way to deploy Windows 8 across your organization?
       </h2>
<p>
        With Windows XP we commonly see situations where a system rebuild takes a day or more. With Windows 8 we have got that down to 45 minutes.
       </p>
<p>
        Windows 8 has deployment tools which you can download, which make it significantly easier for organizations ranging from small to large sizes to migrate to Windows 8.
       </p>
<p>
        Here are you deployment choices:
       </p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>
         Individuals - Standard Installation using Windows 8 CD (not recommended as you then need to install all your programs)
        </li>
<li>
         Small Organizations (less than 100 computers) - Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows 8 ADK) (recommended)
        </li>
<li>
         Large Organizations (100 computers or more) - Windows Deployment Services (WDS)
        </li>
</ol>
<p>
        At SSW, we use option b, which means that you need the new deployment tool which utilizes Image Based Setups (IBS). When you use IBS you install all the programs you create a large .WIM file. Once the custom image is created you deployed individually to each PC as detailed below:
       </p>
<p>
<strong>
         Note:
        </strong>
        for option c, you use the same IBS method described for creation of your image. Windows Deployment Services is the equivalent of Remote Installation Services on Windows Server 2003. For this deployment process, a dedicated server is required.
       </p>
<p>
        In order to use IBS you will need to:
       </p>
<ul>
<li>
         Step 1: Create a CD with the tools needed to deploy the Image
        </li>
<li>
         Step 2: Creating a custom image of a Windows 8 Installation
        </li>
<li>
         Step 3: Get your new PC and Deploy this custom image
        </li>
</ul>
<h3>

<strong>
         Warning:

        If you're using a VPC or VMWare then it is best to create a "Clone" before you generialize so that you can revert back to it after the image has been created.

        Do you run all your incompatible applications in a Virtual PC?

<p>
        When upgrading to Windows 8, you will find that many of your important applications may not install or give errors.
        <br/>
        To ensure a smooth migration process, your image will include a shortcut on the desktop to a Virtual PC so you can continue with all of these incompatible applications.

<h2>
<a name="Gateway">
</a>
        Do you use default gateway on remote network?
       </h2>
<p>
        VPN is a wonderful tool for users to remotely control the other PCs via network. If we control the PC located in Sydney and use default gateway on remote network, some of the bandwidth in Sydney will be occupied by us. In order to avoid that, we need to configure the VPN as following:
       </p>
<dl class="image">
<dt>
<img alt="Gateway" height="489" src="/history/standards/rules/images/default-gateway.gif" width="410"/>
</dt>
<dd>
         Figure: Uncheck "Use default gateway on remote network"
        </dd>
</dl>
<p>
        Furthermore, the Microsoft Firewall Client for ISA Server, which connects with the remote server, will be disabled as well.
       </p>
<p>
        After that we can detect our settings by accessing
        <a href="/SSW/Redirect/Dnsstuff.htm">
         http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/aboutyou.ch

        Using a standard file a structure for storing user data on laptops makes locating important information fast and performing automated backup operations easy.
        <br/>
        Our developers always have:
       </p>
<pre>                D:\DataExchange  - For storing the MS Outlook .OST file. This folder is deliberately separate so it is not backed up. (the Exchange server itself is backed up regularly)<br/><br/>

                D:\DataFirstnameLastname - For storing all user data. This folder is automatically backed up.<br/><br/>

                            \ProjectsTemp<br/><br/>

                            \ProjectsVSS<br/><br/>

<h2>
<a name="BootToVHD">
</a>
        Do you use the "Boot to VHD" feature of Windows 8?
       </h2>
<p>
        Windows 8 introduced a nice feature called "Boot to VHD". This feature allows you to natively boot into a VPC image.
       </p>
<p>
        This has a couple of advantages:
       </p>
<ul>
<li>
         Usage of Aero styles
        </li>
<li>
         Bare metal performance
        </li>
<li>
         64 bit support
        </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2>
<a name="CreateVHD">
</a>
        Do you start from scratch when creating a "boot to VHD" image?
       </h2>
<p>
        When you consider to use the boot to VHD feature, try to install a new VPC image from scratch. All your hardware is direct accessed and not anymore virtualized when you boot into the VHD image, only the HD is virtualized.
        <br/>
        So it is better to start installing a new VPC image from scratch so that all your drivers are up to date and use the full power of your machine.
        <br/>
