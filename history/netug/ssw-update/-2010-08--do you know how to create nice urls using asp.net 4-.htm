                                There are a lot of reasons to have nice URLs for your website:
                            </p>

                                With ASP.NET 4 it is easy to create this URLs. The ASP.NET team includes routing
                                features, known from the MVC web framework.<br/>
                                Add a route in Global.asax

                                Note: IIS7 has a module called URL rewrite module that can do this functionality
                                without changing any code. Just a configuration of a "Rule" in the IIS Manager.

<strong>Interface Usability 
                                -  Adding Schweppervescence</strong></p>
<p>
                                Speaker: Adam Cogan</p>
<p>
                                iPhones give an awesome User Experience but interface design is not something that belongs solely in the world of Apple. Your
                                website and applications can all benefit greatly from an understanding of how your
                                users might navigate your product. Unfortunately for developers, interface usability
                                is something of an afterthought, making your otherwise perfect application suck.</p>
<p>
                                In this session, get real world examples of good and bad usability from Adam. Bring
                                along your websites and applications and undergo the Adam Cogan crash test!
                            </p>
<p>
                                The evening will commence with a detailed discussion of good interface design and
                                usability, and then move onto an analysis of good and bad site examples.</p>
<p>
                                The night will finish with an open floor workshop to discuss user submitted sites
                                and applications, and workshop improvements for attendees as well as a vote on applying the correct architecture in certain situations (Ajax vs Silverlight vs WPF vs HTML5). </p>

                                    Adam Cogan</a></strong></p>
<p>
                                Visual Studio Ultimate (formerly Visual Studio Team System (VSTS)) and Team Foundation
                                Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft .NET platform.
                                These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful projects and for
                                the developers to have a focused and smooth software development process.
                            </p>
<p>
                                Come and see Adam Cogan, Microsoft Regional Director, VSTS Champ and Chief Architect
                                from SSW show you:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to successfully gather requirements with User stories </li>
<li>The right way to use work items </li>
<li>The way to complete a work items and send a 'done' </li>
<li>Use templates for your standard work items </li>
<li>The extra work items that developers always forget </li>
<li>What is good and bad about Excel and Project integration </li>
<li>What you can use from the built in reporting as well as the Project portals available
                                    on from the SharePoint dashboard </li>
<li>The important reports to give your Project Manager </li>
</ul>
<p>
                                Walk away knowing how to see the project health and progress. Visual Studio Ultimate
                                is designed to help address many of these traditional problems faced by project
                                managers. It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to help teams improve
                                their software development activities and to help project managers better support
                                the software development processes.</p>
<p>
                                During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating work items and tracking
                                of releases using Visual Studio Ultimate and Team Foundation Server.</p>
<strong>Visual Studio 2010 Team System - An Overview </strong>
<p>
                                Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Team System is an integrated software development platform
                                to build the mission-critical applications that businesses depend on. It extends
                                Visual Studio's integrated and productive experience from the developer to the entire
                                development team by delivering powerful new role-based tools for software architects,
                                developers, testers and project managers. In this session you will see an overview
                                of these tools and how they can improve your software development cycle.
                            </p>
<strong>Visual Studio 2010 Testing with Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2010 - the life
                                of a bug </strong>
<p>
                                Visual Studio 2010 makes up a large part of a .Net developers life. This session
                                will delve into the 'life of a bug' by taking a walk in the shoes of an everyday
                                bug from discovery to release (and the steps that make up the in between). Come
                                along and check out the new features that will make you happier by making your code
                                better, your job easier, and your team more productive by reducing the obstacles
                                you face in your everyday coding life. Learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the new features for testers and developers </li>
<li>How you now care - even if the tester can't reproduce the bug </li>
<li>How to stop struggling to find the source of the bug in your code</li>
<li>How can you streamline the testing process and make sure you don't repeat the same
                                    bugs</li>
<li>How to automate more and reproduce bugs easier and discover problems sooner.</li>
</ul>
<strong>What's new in SharePoint 2010</strong>
<p>
                                In this session Adam Cogan will provide information about what is new in SharePoint
                                2010 and his personal favorites. The SharePoint Team has invested in many including:
                            </p>
<ul>
<li>UX support for Silverlight and Ajax </li>
<li>their Web Content Management System </li>
<li>Digital Asset Management System (for videos) </li>
<li>Visual Studio 2010 tools for SharePoint 2010 </li>
<li>Developer Platform </li>
<li>Office 2010 integration </li>
<li>RESTful Web API </li>
<li>Tagging and Rating</li>
</ul>
<p>
                                Let's see what's good and what's not.</p>
<strong>Something About Mary (SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010)</strong>
<p>
                                Come see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint and Office for Mary
                                and the other knowledge workers.</p>
<p>
                                First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your
                                business. Then see real world examples of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together (Comparing with what with had with
                                    2007)</li>
<li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
<li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes (separate
                                    from SharePoint), and then followed by </li>
<li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to improve
                                    visibility/searchability/versioning across the company </li>
<li>Overview of how data can be synchronised between the two (eg using Access and Excel)
                                </li>
<li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means </li>
<li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint </li>
<li>High level examples of using/integrating Office with other products (eg VSTS integration
                                    with Outlook) </li>
<li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>
<li>Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations (eg the <a class="external" href="hhttp://www.atlassian.com/software/sharepoint-connector/overview" target="_blank">Atlassian SharePoint Connector</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.atlassian.com/office" target="_blank">Office Connector</a>) </li>
</ul>
<p>
                                This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your company,
                                along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session because too often
                                companies limit Office to just an email application, word processor and spreadsheet
                                - completely missing the positive impact it can have on the entire business process.</p>

                                code analysis tool that allows developers to take control of your code, ensuring
                                large, complex source code can be simplified, cleaned and maintained. The built-in
                                rules focus on the most popular .NET languages (C#, VB.NET) for both Windows Forms
                                and ASP.NET; however, the flexibility of SSW Code Auditor allows the developer to
                                add their own rules to target any language in any text file.</p>

                                This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your company,
                                along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session because too often
                                companies limit Office to just an email application, word processor and spreadsheet
                                - completely missing the positive impact it can have on the entire business process.</p>
