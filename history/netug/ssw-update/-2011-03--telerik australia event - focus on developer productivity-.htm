<strong>The Agile Buffet Table: Implementing your own Agile Process  with Microsoft ALM Tools - 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM </strong>
<p>
                    New to Agile? Having challenges implementing an agile process in your organization? Have you been using Scrum, 
                    but need to bend the rules to make it work in your organization? Can’t get the business to “buy-in”? Come and 
                    learn about implementing an agile process in your organization. You'll look at the “buffet table” of agile 
                    processes and procedures and learn how to properly decide “what to eat.”  We’ll start by defining XP, Scrum, 
                    Kanban and some other popular methodologies and then learn how to mix and match each process for various scenarios, 
                    including the enterprise, ISVs, consulting, and remote teams. Then take a look at agile tools and how they will 
                    aid in implementing your development process. You’ll see how Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010 provides 
                    process templates for Agile that facilitate better planning and metrics. Learn how Microsoft’s application 
                    lifecycle management (ALM) tools can support your development process. Lastly, we will talk about how to “sell” 
                    agile to your business partners and customers. The speakers have a very interactive style so participation is 
                    encouraged and there will be plenty of time for Q&amp;A.

<strong>Agile Testing - 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM</strong>
<p>
                    As more product teams move to Agile methodologies, the need for automated testing becomes essential to generate 
                    the velocity needed to ship fully tested features in short iterations. In this session we will look at the 
                    differences between traditional testing and agile testing, explore some tools and strategies that can help make 
                    your automation more productive as well as how to get the automation effort started for both new and existing 
                    agile projects.

<p><strong>Taking Agile Teams from an Idea to a Test - Friday 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM </strong></p>
<p>
                    The hardest aspects of an Agile project are getting started and knowing when you’re done.  Where do requirements 
                    come from and what should they look like?  How do you make sure that your project aligns to its original intent?  
                    How to you use Agile estimation and planning to go from an idea into a plan?  How can you help ensure your team 
                    is following best practices as well as track progress?  How can you ensure the ongoing quality of your software, 
                    even as it rapidly evolves.
                </p>
<p>
                    In this session, Telerik will address all of these questions by discussing best practices as well as demonstrating 
                    how their productivity and testing tools can dramatically improve quality while reducing waste and rework and 
                    increasing team efficiency and focus.

<strong>Team Foundation Server 2010 for Successful Project Management by <a href="https://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Adam.aspx?utm_source=SSWUpdate022011&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=SSW%2BUpdate%2BSharePoint%2B101">
                    Adam Cogan</a></strong></p>
<p>
            Visual Studio Ultimate (formerly Visual Studio Team System (VSTS)) and Team 
            Foundation Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft 
            .NET platform. These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful 
            projects and for the developers to have a focused and smooth software 
            development process.
        </p>
<p>
            Come and see Adam Cogan, Microsoft Regional Director, VSTS Champ and Chief 
            Architect from SSW show you:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to successfully gather requirements with User stories </li>
<li>The right way to use work items </li>
<li>The way to complete a work items and send a 'done' </li>
<li>Use templates for your standard work items </li>
<li>The extra work items that developers always forget </li>
<li>What is good and bad about Excel and Project integration </li>
<li>What you can use from the built in reporting as well as the Project portals 
                    available on from the SharePoint dashboard </li>
<li>The important reports to give your Project Manager </li>
</ul>
<p>
            Walk away knowing how to see the project health and progress. Visual Studio 
            Ultimate is designed to help address many of these traditional problems faced by 
            project managers. It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to help 
            teams improve their software development activities and to help project managers 
            better support the software development processes.</p>
<p>
            During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating work items and 
            tracking of releases using Visual Studio Ultimate and Team Foundation Server.</p>
<strong>Visual Studio 2010 Team System - An Overview </strong>
<p>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Team System is an integrated software development 
            platform to build the mission-critical applications that businesses depend on. 
            It extends Visual Studio's integrated and productive experience from the 
            developer to the entire development team by delivering powerful new role-based 
            tools for software architects, developers, testers and project managers. In this 
            session you will see an overview of these tools and how they can improve your 
            software development cycle. </p>
<strong>Visual Studio 2010 Testing with Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2010 - the life of a 
                bug </strong>
<p>Visual Studio 2010 makes up a large part of a .Net developers life. This session 
            will delve into the 'life of a bug' by taking a walk in the shoes of an everyday 
            bug from discovery to release (and the steps that make up the in between). Come 
            along and check out the new features that will make you happier by making your 
            code better, your job easier, and your team more productive by reducing the 
            obstacles you face in your everyday coding life. Learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the new features for testers and developers </li>
<li>How you now care - even if the tester can't reproduce the bug </li>
<li>How to stop struggling to find the source of the bug in your code</li>
<li>How can you streamline the testing process and make sure you don't repeat the 
                same bugs</li>
<li>How to automate more and reproduce bugs easier and discover problems sooner.</li>
</ul>
<strong>What's new in SharePoint 2010</strong>
<p>In this session Adam Cogan will provide information about what is new in 
            SharePoint 2010 and his personal favorites. The SharePoint Team has invested in 
            many including: </p>
<ul>
<li>UX support for Silverlight and Ajax </li>
<li>their Web Content Management System </li>
<li>Digital Asset Management System (for videos) </li>
<li>Visual Studio 2010 tools for SharePoint 2010 </li>
<li>Developer Platform </li>
<li>Office 2010 integration </li>
<li>RESTful Web API </li>
<li>Tagging and Rating</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see what's good and what's not.</p>
<strong>Something About Mary (SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010)</strong>
<p>
            Come see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint and Office for Mary 
            and the other knowledge workers.</p>
<p>First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your 
            business. Then see real world examples of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together (Comparing with what with had 
                    with 2007)</li>
<li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
<li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes 
                    (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by </li>
<li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to 
                    improve visibility/searchability/versioning across the company </li>
<li>Overview of how data can be synchronised between the two (e.g. using Access and 
                    Excel) </li>
<li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means </li>
<li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint </li>
<li>High level examples of using/integrating Office with other products (e.g. VSTS 
                    integration with Outlook) </li>
<li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>
<li>Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations (e.g. the <a class="external" href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/sharepoint-connector/overview" target="_blank">
                    Atlassian SharePoint Connector</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.atlassian.com/office?utm_source=SSWUpdate022011&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=SSW%2BUpdate%2BSharePoint%2B101" target="_blank">
                    Office Connector</a>) </li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your 
            company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session 
            because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word 
            processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have 
            on the entire business process.</p>
