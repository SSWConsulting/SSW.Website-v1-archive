<p>G'Day Developers!</p>
<p>
                    This is to prevent their work affecting other developers. During development, you can expect many of these things to happen:
                </p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>IIS resets may need to be done frequently, which stops the SharePoint website working. </li>
<li>Custom webparts can easily introduce memory leaks which can stop SharePoint working. </li>
<li>You may be running development SharePoint in debugging mode which would hold the server thread. </li>
<li>You may be reading event or error logs that are being polluted by other developers simultaneously. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, all SharePoint customization and development must be done on a Virtual Machine. No ifs, no buts.</p>
<ol>
<li>It's very important to correctly setup a SharePoint environment for development. Correctly configured, this will save you a lot of trouble later on. </li>
<li>From time to time, you can seriously screw/damage a SharePoint installation during development and it is best not to install SharePoint on your day-to-day machine. </li>
<li>Additionally, when you start a new SharePoint project you don't want to carry all the baggage from previous customizations that could potentially affect your new project. </li>
</ol>
<p>There are many other benefits of using a virtual machine for development</p>
<ol>
<li>Virtual machines can be fired up and shut down easily </li>
<li>Virtual machines can run faster, via being located on a different server and thus it doesn't waste developers' own computer resources </li>
<li>Virtual machines can be copied and brought to a client for demonstration or testing </li>
<li>They are the best way to quickly test or experiment with something new </li>
<li>Virtual machines can frees up resources on the host, so it doesn’t waste resource when developers are not working on SharePoint </li>
<li>Virtual machines can be easily cloned to scale up the development team </li>
<li>Virtual machines enable developers to work in Windows Server 2003 / 2008 environment so they will be aware of the configuration issue when deploying to staging and production </li>
</ol>
<p>There are few consideration when using Virtual Machines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Need to activate additional servers </li>
<li>Need at least 2 GB of RAM for SharePoint 2007 </li>
<li>Need at least 4 GB of RAM for SharePoint 2010</li>
<li>Virtual PC does not support 64 bit Operating Systems</li>
<li>If you’re using Windows 7 or Vista, we recommend using ‘boot to VHD’ or VMWare </li>
</ol>
<p>
                    If you are after a clean, pre-configured SharePoint server image to test SharePoint, the easiest way is to <a class="ms-rteCustom-External" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=67f93dcb-ada8-4db5-a47b-df17e14b2c74&amp;displaylang=en&amp;utm_source=SSWUpdateJuly&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=SSW%2BUpdate%2B-%2BDo%2Byou%2Bknow%2Bthat%2Bdevelopers%2Bshould%2Bdo%2Ball%2Btheir%2Bcustom%2Bwork%2Bin%2Btheir%2Bown%2BSharePoint%2Bdevelopment%2Benvironment%3F">download a trial VM from Microsoft</a></p>

<p>This month Justin King will be doing a toolset double session on Visual Studio 2010 
        (a lot of this will still be relevant to Visual Studio 2008). </p>
<p><strong>Know your IDE – Productivity Tips to speed your coding</strong></p>
<p>Speaker: Justin King</p>
<p>
            We all use Visual Studio to code all day but do you really get the most out of the IDE? In this session, 
            Justin will show over 50 tips/tricks in Visual Studio 2010 to speed up your development process. Justin 
            will also demonstrate Devexpress Code Rush and show you how to take your development to the next level, 
            both in speed but also productivity on repetitive tasks.
        </p>
<p><strong>Debugging 101 – Learn to Debug</strong></p>
<p>Speaker: Justin King</p>
<p> 
            One of the fundamental things a developer does is to solve problems. Learning the toolset to be an 
            efficient debugger and learning how to quickly identify bugs and potential problems. In this session, 
            Justin will show the new debugging features in Visual Studio 2010 and cover items such as Watchlists, Breakpoints, 
            Locals,  WinDbg and working with Dump files, attaching to Processes and using Symbols to look into the .NET 
            source code. If time permits, we will take a look at profiling an application to identify performance issues 
            with ANTS Profiler.

<p><strong>Unity Injection for ASP.Net and WCF</strong> by <a href="http://www.neovolve.com/">Rory Primrose</a></p>
<p>
                    Unity is the Microsoft Patterns and Practises implementation of an inversion of control (IoC) container. 
                    Using IoC containers facilitates the dependency injection pattern which helps to decouple code from its 
                    dependencies. 
                </p>
<p>
                    A common way to implement IoC in ASP.Net and WCF services is to couple the hosted application to the IoC 
                    container. The first half of this session will look at how ASP.Net and WCF applications can be extended 
                    to leverage the benefits of IoC while decoupling the hosted application from the container.
                </p>
<p>
                    The second half of the session will look at how Unity can be extended to provide a recursive disposal 
                    pattern for build trees created by the container.

<strong>Team Foundation Server 2010 for Successful Project Management by <a href="https://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/AboutUs/Employees/Pages/Adam.aspx?utm_source=SSWUpdateJuly&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=SSW%2BUpdate%2B-%2BDo%2Byou%2Bknow%2Bthat%2Bdevelopers%2Bshould%2Bdo%2Ball%2Btheir%2Bcustom%2Bwork%2Bin%2Btheir%2Bown%2BSharePoint%2Bdevelopment%2Benvironment%3F">
                    Adam Cogan</a></strong></p>
<p>
            Visual Studio Ultimate (formerly Visual Studio Team System (VSTS)) and Team 
            Foundation Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft 
            .NET platform. These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful 
            projects and for the developers to have a focused and smooth software 
            development process.
        </p>
<p>
            Come and see Adam Cogan, Microsoft Regional Director, VSTS Champ and Chief 
            Architect from SSW show you:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to successfully gather requirements with User stories </li>
<li>The right way to use work items </li>
<li>The way to complete a work items and send a 'done' </li>
<li>Use templates for your standard work items </li>
<li>The extra work items that developers always forget </li>
<li>What is good and bad about Excel and Project integration </li>
<li>What you can use from the built in reporting as well as the Project portals 
                    available on from the SharePoint dashboard </li>
<li>The important reports to give your Project Manager </li>
</ul>
<p>
            Walk away knowing how to see the project health and progress. Visual Studio 
            Ultimate is designed to help address many of these traditional problems faced by 
            project managers. It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to help 
            teams improve their software development activities and to help project managers 
            better support the software development processes.</p>
<p>
            During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating work items and 
            tracking of releases using Visual Studio Ultimate and Team Foundation Server.</p>
<strong>Visual Studio 2010 Team System - An Overview </strong>
<p>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Team System is an integrated software development 
            platform to build the mission-critical applications that businesses depend on. 
            It extends Visual Studio's integrated and productive experience from the 
            developer to the entire development team by delivering powerful new role-based 
            tools for software architects, developers, testers and project managers. In this 
            session you will see an overview of these tools and how they can improve your 
            software development cycle. </p>
<strong>Visual Studio 2010 Testing with Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2010 - the life of a 
                bug </strong>
<p>Visual Studio 2010 makes up a large part of a .Net developers life. This session 
            will delve into the 'life of a bug' by taking a walk in the shoes of an everyday 
            bug from discovery to release (and the steps that make up the in between). Come 
            along and check out the new features that will make you happier by making your 
            code better, your job easier, and your team more productive by reducing the 
            obstacles you face in your everyday coding life. Learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the new features for testers and developers </li>
<li>How you now care - even if the tester can't reproduce the bug </li>
<li>How to stop struggling to find the source of the bug in your code</li>
<li>How can you streamline the testing process and make sure you don't repeat the 
                same bugs</li>
<li>How to automate more and reproduce bugs easier and discover problems sooner.</li>

<p>In this session Adam Cogan will provide information about what is new in 
            SharePoint 2010 and his personal favorites. The SharePoint Team has invested in 
            many including: </p>
<ul>
<li>UX support for Silverlight and Ajax </li>
<li>their Web Content Management System </li>
<li>Digital Asset Management System (for videos) </li>
<li>Visual Studio 2010 tools for SharePoint 2010 </li>
<li>Developer Platform </li>
<li>Office 2010 integration </li>
<li>RESTful Web API </li>
<li>Tagging and Rating</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see what's good and what's not.</p>
<strong>Something About Mary (SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010)</strong>
<p>
            Come see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint and Office for Mary 
            and the other knowledge workers.</p>
<p>First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your 
            business. Then see real world examples of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together (Comparing with what with had 
                    with 2007)</li>
<li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
<li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes 
                    (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by </li>
<li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to 
                    improve visibility/searchability/versioning across the company </li>
<li>Overview of how data can be synchronised between the two (eg using Access and 
                    Excel) </li>
<li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means </li>
<li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint </li>
<li>High level examples of using/integrating Office with other products (eg VSTS 
                    integration with Outlook) </li>
<li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>
<li>Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations (eg the <a class="external" href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/sharepoint-connector/overview" target="_blank">
                    Atlassian SharePoint Connector</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.atlassian.com/office?utm_source=SSWUpdateJuly&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=SSW%2BUpdate%2B-%2BDo%2Byou%2Bknow%2Bthat%2Bdevelopers%2Bshould%2Bdo%2Ball%2Btheir%2Bcustom%2Bwork%2Bin%2Btheir%2Bown%2BSharePoint%2Bdevelopment%2Benvironment%3F" target="_blank">
                    Office Connector</a>) </li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your 
            company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session 
            because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word 
            processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have 
            on the entire business process.</p>

                    This course introduces students the Microsoft .NET 3.5 Framework through hands-on exercises 
                    and live demos. C# is provided side-by-side giving the students a deeper understanding of the 
                    commonalities between the languages. The class examples can be completed in C#. The course

<strong>Automate your Code Reviews with SSW Code Auditor</strong></p>

				large, complex source code can be simplified, cleaned and maintained. The built-in

<p>Come and see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint and Office for 
                    Mary and the other knowledge workers.</p>
<p>First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your 
                    business.</p>
<p>Then see real world examples of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together</li>
<li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
<li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes 
                                    (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by</li>
<li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to 
                                    improve visibility/ searchability/ versioning across the company</li>
<li>Overview of how data can be synchronized between SharePoint and external data 
                                    sources (eg using Access and Excel)</li>
<li>Overview of what 'workflow' really means!</li>
<li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint</li>
<li>Extending SharePoint with Office SharePoint Designer 2010 (free!)</li>
<li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>
<li>Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations (eg the 
                                    Atlassian SharePoint Connector and Atlassian Office Connector)</li>
</ul>
<p>
                    This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your 
                    company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session 
                    because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word 
                    processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have 
                    on the entire business process.</p>
