<h1>[<span class="magazineTitle">the cutting edge</span> ]</h1>
<p><b>G'day Developers!</b></p>
<p>Recently Lei Xu and I completed a hair-raising TFS 2012 project. We hit some snags trying to optimize Work Items with 20,000,000 records. Let me tell you the story...</p>
<p>
                                It was completed shortly after arriving home from the <a href="http://www.2013mvpsummit.com/" title="MVP Summit">MVP Summit</a> in Redmond. 
                    It was lucky we were full of information from Brian Harry and his team. This job turned out to be one of the most challenging that I've ever done, 
                    pushing the performance limits of Team Foundation Server 2012 (these tips apply to TFS 2013 and 2010 as well).
                            </p>

</p>
<b>Figure: Brian Harry and Lei Xu @ MVP Summit</b>
<p>
                                First some background: the client runs one of the biggest development teams in the world. They have over 20,000 developers and have a lot of experience gathering, 
                    analyzing and acting on performance metrics acquired while testing software prior to wide scale deployment. 
                    The system we needed to implement and customize had to cope with a massive number of concurrent requests, of course in very timely fashion. 
                    We used the TFS Integration Platform and the TFS Object Model to implement most of the functionality required.
                            </p>
<p>
                                Initially we thought TFS should be able to handle the load without too many problems, because Microsoft has been 
                    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2009/09/04/dogfooding-tfs-2010-in-devdiv.aspx">dogfooding TFS in their developer division</a>
                                for a long time, with great results.
                            </p>
<p>
                                However, like every story, things will never run as you expect. Once the coding was done, with all the data access, business logic and interface implementations on top
                     of TFS Object Model, it was time for the 1<sup>st</sup> performance tests.
                            </p>
<p>The initial results were disappointing...</p>

                                Professional Scrum Developer courses teach students how to work in a team - using modern software engineering practices - to develop 
                            an increment of potentially releasable functionality using a specific technology platform.
                            </p>
<p>
                                Classes are exercise-driven, with students working in self-organizing teams to develop "done" increments from Product Backlog items.

<strong>Course at a Glance:</strong>
</p>
<p>
                                This 3-day Professional Scrum Developer .NET course is a mix of lecture, demonstration, group discussion, simulation, and hands-on 
                            software development. The bulk of the course will be spent working as a team on a case study application delivering increments of new 
                            functionality in mini-sprints. Here is the course at a glance:

<p><strong>"Great Intranets of the Modern Age" - James Robertson</strong></p>
<p>Intranets have been around for a long time now, but SharePoint has brought new functionality and capability into organisations that promises to transform these sites.</p>
<p>
                                But what direction should we be heading, and what makes a truly great intranet? This presentation, by the world's leading intranet expert, will provide a 
                            practical and inspirational view of the role that intranets can (and should) play.
                            </p>
<p>
                                Many real-world screenshots of intranets will be shared, focusing on SharePoint sites and solutions. 
                        These include winners from the global Intranet Innovation Awards.

                                Randtronics introduces SPYRUS Secure Portable Workplace which offers “Secured by SPYRUS™” military grade encryption technology in a Microsoft certified and 
                        tested Windows To Go drive that runs Windows 8 from non-secure environments. The presenter will provide technical details and a technology demonstration on how

<p>
                                Joanna's role at SSW is Personal Assistant to Chief Architect Adam Cogan, as well as the day-to-day running of the office. 
                         She helps organise SSW training events and User Groups, and also puts together the regular newsletter that is distributed to company friends and 
                            clients to keep them in the loop with what's happening at SSW.
                            </p>

<h2>JASON BERES 5-7PM</h2>
<p><b>Interaction design with Indigo Studio</b></p>
<p>
                                Rather than spending weeks creating a prototype in code, Indigo Studio is a FREE tool that allows you to rapidly iterate and validate designs 
                        by creating interactive prototypes.
                            </p>
<p>Jason will show how to create prototypes and share them as an interactive HTML5 app that can then be used to allow users to test on a variety of devices.</p>
<p><b>Building MVVM JavaScript Apps for the C# / XAML Developer </b></p>
<p>Jason Beres will teach developers how to implement the MVVM pattern in HTML5/JavaScript using the Knockout JS library. </p>
<p>
                                Key topics covered include a review of MVVM Fundamentals, a walkthrough of simple WPF MVVM line-of-business application, an introduction to the Knockout 
                        JS library and a walkthrough of an HTML5/JS version of the WPF MVVM line-of-business application.
                            </p>

<p><b>C# on a diet with scriptcs</b></p>
<p>
                                Have you ever found times where you just want to write and execute some C# code and you ask yourself Do I really need an IDE? a solution? a project? a class? 
                        Do I really need to compile? Why do I have to worry about all these dlls? if you've done any development with dynamic languages like Ruby, Python or node.js the 
                        answer is you don't. But what about C#? scriptcs (https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs) is new way to develop C# applications as script. It leverages compiler 
                        advancements of Roslyn and combines the power of nuget to offer a low calorie approach to working with C#. It's great for prototyping, simple scripting or even 
                        building simple apps. Not only does it let you write scripted "apps", but it also includes a REPL so you can execute code interactively. You can even debug. 
                        Come to this talk and it will change the way you think about C# development.
                            </p>

<p>Ease your mobile app development to the cloud powered by Javascript with Azure Mobile Services</p>
</b>
<p>
                                Javascript, it's not just for browsers anymore. If you are a Javascript developer today you are no longer confined to the browser frame, you can take those 
                        skills to mobile devices, servers and the cloud. The technology makes it possible, but it's not easy. You've got a lot of learning to do and a lot of things to 
                        worry about like data, identity, validation, push, scale and diagnostics to name a few. Azure Mobile Services is there to make it easy. It provides you a ton of 
                        backend services out of the box to help you cloud enable those client apps utilizing the client side Javascript skills you already have. If you are a node developer 
                        you can go even further. It doesn't stop there though, it includes client SDKs for IOS, Android, WIndows 8 and a newly announced library for Phonegap/HTML5 which 
                        you can use to reach any device anywhere. You have to just see it to believe it, and if you come to this talk you will!
