<p><b>G'day Developers!</b></p>
<p><b>The SPARROW project for Brisbane Catholic Education: When Scrum fosters collaboration</b><br/></p>
<p><img alt="BCE Sparrow" src="http://ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/SSWUpdate/Images/BCESparrow.jpg" width="470"/><br/>
<b>Figure: BCE SPARROW uses a 'metro' design with all the latest Nuget packages for elegant, consistent and usable design</b></p>
<p>The benefits of continually improving our processes and practices around the Scrum methodology were never more apparent than with the project we have recently completed for Brisbane Catholic Education (BCE).<br/>
        As developers, we’ve all worked on projects where the level of collaboration can break down due to any number of factors such as scope creep, availability of the Product Owner, ill-defined requirements or inadequate testing. One of the strongest benefits of Scrum is the focus on communication and feedback to alleviate these symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>The BCE SPARROW Project</strong><br/>
        The SPARROW project is an extranet site designed to assist school principals when performing long term strategic planning for their school. As such, this was a project with many stakeholders.<br/>
        On arrival, we found that BCE were ready for Scrum. They had tried applying agile principles to their own projects previously and were interested in formalizing the process. Following Scrum helped us to build a single collaborative development team comprising developers and a designer from SSW with testers and IT staff from BCE. The SSW team for this project included

<p><strong>Client Role: The Product Owner</strong><br/>
        It was a pleasure to work with an excellent Product Owner from BCE, Kerry Edwards-Williams. Kerry performed brilliantly at managing the diversity of stakeholder input to give the develoment team a single source of truth for tasks on the Product Backlog. For more information on this key role see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eljozEWpf8">What is a Product Owner</a>.</p>

I think it's absolutely exceptional. It's fantastic. I think my favorite thing about working on the project, was learning about the scrum methodology... and working with the SSW team... I'd highly recommend them to anybody." - Kerry Edwards-Williams.</p></blockquote></td> </tr> </table>
<p><strong>Client Role: The Tester</strong><br/>
        BCE Testers, led by Latha Matta, used Microsoft Test Manager to provide excellent bug reports directly into TFS – as per our rule: <a href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/Do-you-know-the-3-steps-to-a-PBI.aspx?utm_source=SSWUpdate_January&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=FireBootCamp is one week away from ignitionn">Do you know the three steps to a PBI?</a><br/>
        Making client testers part of the development team worked to break down barriers between client and vendor and fostered mutual understanding and respect. This, in turn, led to fantastic turnaround times in identifying and responding to issues.</p>

                                Professional Scrum Developer courses teach students how to work in a team - using modern software engineering practices - to develop 
                            an increment of potentially releasable functionality using a specific technology platform.

<p>
                                Classes are exercise-driven, with students working in self-organizing teams to develop "done" increments from Product Backlog items.

<strong>Course at a Glance:</strong>
</p>
<p>
                                This 3-day Professional Scrum Developer .NET course is a mix of lecture, demonstration, group discussion, simulation, and hands-on 
                            software development. The bulk of the course will be spent working as a team on a case study application delivering increments of new 
                            functionality in mini-sprints. Here is the course at a glance:

<p><strong>"Building highly scalable HTML5 web and mobile applications with Tribe" - Dale Anderson</strong></p>
<p>It is widely accepted in the industry that messaging patterns like CQRS can facilitate massively scalable applications with loosely coupled components. 
            Tribe takes a different approach to current single page web application frameworks by providing a full composite UI framework with a messaging platform 
            at its core. This enables the rapid development of highly scalable applications built on patterns like CQRS in a simple and intuitive way. The platform also 
            enables seamless, real time distribution of objects on a large scale across multiple devices.</p>
<p>First, we'll briefly discuss some of the concepts behind messaging patterns like CQRS. Then we'll build a simple chat application that targets both browsers 
            and mobile devices (hopefully using a preview of the upcoming nodejs based release), showcasing how Tribe is focused around removing common pain points and 
            repetitive tasks in developing web applications. Finally we'll cover how the concepts discussed earlier can be applied using the platform and have a quick 
            look at the product roadmap.</p>
<p><b>About the presenter:</b><br/>
           Dale Anderson is an exceptionally passionate software engineer. He lives and breathes the stuff every day and loves every moment.</p>
<p>Lucky to have been born in the age when Steve Jobs was busy changing the world, Dale fondly remembers hacking on his dad's Apple 
            II Plus as a youngster, fervently and conscientiously transcribing code from the pages of computing magazines and then excitedly watching 
            the green ASCII characters fly across the screen as the program came to life. Later, the idea of networking computers together fascinated 
            him, driving his parents crazy by tying up the phone line for hours on end as the modem clicked and buzzed away at a blazing 2,400 bits 
            every second. Dale was even nerdy enough to read the entire RFC specifications for the TCP/IP protocols and various other incredibly 
            dry pieces of literature.</p>
<p>Dale has spent most of his 13+ year career focused on the Microsoft technology stack, working with a wide range of government and corporate 
            clients, specialising in solution architecture. He has in depth knowledge of a broad range of Microsoft technologies, covering web, desktop 
            and middleware stacks. Over the last few years, Dale founded a startup, SportingTribe, and in the process, has become an expert in open source web
            technologies. He has produced a number of open source projects in that domain (<a href="http://tribejs.com/">http://tribejs.com/</a> and 
            <a href="http://tribejs.com/">http://packscript.com/</a>).</p>
