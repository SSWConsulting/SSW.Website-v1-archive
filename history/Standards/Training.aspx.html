                ADO.NET is a significant upgrade from ADO, and it changes the techniques for working
                with data. Whether the data is from SQL Server 2005, a Jet MDB file, an XML file,
                or almost any other data source, ADO.NET provides the tools for working with your
                data. This session introduces the basics of ADO.NET, and demonstrates how to retrieve

                Learn how you can harness Visual Studio .NET's deep XML support with ADO .NET to
                integrate interoperable, robust data access into your applications and components.
                The .NET framework includes many new classes for data access that require a fundamentally
                different way of using data than in ADO classic. This includes relational data,
                XML data, and other data stores, collectively making up the new ADO.NET. It is designed
                to simplify data access, reduce network traffic, and support distributed, disconnected
                applications. You'll find out how to code the ADO .NET to access the data in SQL
                Server 2005 and the use of strongly typed datasets using XSD and SQL Server 2005

                ClickOnce provides a rich set of easy to use capabilities for deploying and updating

<p>
                The problem for developers is that ClickOnce provides so much flexibility for getting

            </p>
<p>
                Also covered will be how to version your ClickOnce applications to control who gets

                SQL Server 2005: Advanced Indexing Strategies</h2>
<p>
                In this session we look at a fast-paced collection of indexing tips and tricks based
                on an already optimized base table structure. How you create your base table - as
                well as cluster it - has a big impact on that table's performance.
            </p>
<p>
                Once the base table structures have been defined and you have to further improve
                system performance, where do you look and how do you do this? In this session we
                will talk about targeting both the known and finding the unknown performance problems.
                Once you know where the problems are we'll go through numerous options to improve
                the performance using indexes.
