<p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			1) ANOTHER MONTH, ANOTHER UPDATE<br/>
			---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			We may have reached the point where it's completely impossible to determine 
			what version of which files are
			<br/>
			installed when you're running Microsoft Access. The latest evidence: Knowledge 
			Base article Q321076, "Updated
			<br/>
			Version of Jet Replication Files Available." You can read this at
			<br/>
			http://www.uptilt.com/ct.html?s=5bo,k44,4o2,1zm0,kc45,1e8r,f7ou</p>
<p>if you like. The gist of it is that they apparently forgot to ship two files 
			with Jet 4.0 Service Pack 6, so
			<br/>
			there's a little download that you can grab to install them. However, the files 
			WERE in Jet 4.0 Service Pack 5.
			<br/>
			So, unless you went straight from SP4 or earlier to SP6, you should be fine.</p>
<p>And also on the subject of obscure updates: The Universal Data Access site now 
			has the "MDAC 2.7 RTM Refresh." Even
			<br/>
			after reading the site, I'm not sure whether there's anything more to this one 
			than a change of version
			<br/>
			numbers for some files; if you'd like to look for yourself, check out 
			http://www.microsoft.com/data/download.htm.</p>
<p>Between service packs, security updates, refreshes, bug fixes, QFEs, and who 
			knows what else, you could probably
			<br/>
			configure 500 different versions of the data access files on a Windows computer 
			without half trying. That's too many.
			<br/>
			Unfortunately, I don't see any break in this pattern until we get some new 
			drivers written from the ground up,
			<br/>
			and probably not even then.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			2) WEB SERVICES IN ACCESS: A WORKED EXAMPLE<br/>
			---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			If you're still puzzling about how to integrate XML Web Services with Microsoft 
			Access (assuming you care, that
			<br/>
			is), there's a new article on MSDN that will help. "How to Create and 
			Deploy XML Web Services Using Visual Studio
			<br/>
			.NET and Office XP" 
			http://www.uptilt.com/ct.html?s=5bo,k44,4o2,jd1a,m88d,1e8r,f7ou<br/>
			is from Microsoft's Frank Rice. Using Visual Studio .NET, Office XP, and the 
			Office XP Web Services Toolkit, he
			<br/>
			walks you through the entire process, from understanding the architecture to 
			building both the server and the client.</p>
<p>So, if you can do this today, why am I still pushing for full .NET integration 
			in the next version of Office?
			<br/>
			Because, as it stands, Office is positioned only as a *consumer* of Web 
			Services. Those of us who launched our
			<br/>
			development careers in Access would really like to see Access as a *supplier* 
			of Web Services as well. After
			<br/>
			all, some huge number of Web Services are going to offer data as their product. 
			Right now, it's fairly easy to
			<br/>
			build those in Visual Studio .NET, using the ADO.NET data objects. But imagine 
			what a future version of Access
			<br/>
			could bring to the table: a Web Services Wizard resembling the current form, 
			report, or data access page
			<br/>
			wizards, that could produce a Web Service with minimal user intervention. Now 
			*that* would be cool.</p>
<p>Well, I can dream, can't I?
		</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			3) SURVEY RESULTS<br/>
			---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			Last month, I asked you about database size. For a change, the questions were 
			pretty simple, so here's how
			<br/>
			the numbers came out:</p>
<p>What's the largest number of objects (tables, forms, reports, and so on) you've 
			ever worked with in a single
			<br/>
			Access database?</p>
<p>11-50 -- 11<br/>
			51-100 -- 21<br/>
			101-500 -- 74<br/>
			501-1000 -- 26<br/>
			Over 1000 -- 12
			<br/>
<br/>
			How large is the largest Access database you've ever worked with?</p>
<p>0-100KB -- 2<br/>
			101KB-1MB -- 7<br/>
			2MB-10MB -- 23<br/>
			11MB-100MB -- 60<br/>
			101MB-1GB -- 40<br/>
			Over 1 GB -- 12
			<br/>
<br/>
			How large is the largest back-end database you've ever worked with from Access?</p>
<p>0-1MB -- 9<br/>
			1MB-100MB -- 45<br/>
			101MB-1GB -- 48<br/>
			2GB-100GB -- 25<br/>
			101GB-1TB -- 7<br/>
			Over 1TB -- 2
			<br/>
<br/>
			Have you "hit the wall" in terms of database size and been forced to 
			switch from Access to another database?</p>
<p>Yes -- 35<br/>
			No -- 109
		</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there are some pretty large databases out there; you folks do 
			an adequate job of disproving the
			<br/>
			perennial slander that Access is only suitable for tiny jobs (and I'm jealous 
			of those of you playing with those
			<br/>
			terabyte databases). And there was a bunch of interesting comments, too. Here's 
			a sampling:</p>
<p>"I have had good success using a 100-200MB Access database with about three 
			concurrent (with lots of
			<br/>
			activity) users. We had both the backend and frontend (both MDBs just split 
			out) on a file server. Although
			<br/>
			probably not directly related to the size of this database, we had a series of 
			about 40 nested action
			<br/>
			queries that we needed to run sequentially to process a batch. These were 
			initially taking from 5-10 minutes each
			<br/>
			to run (yes, each query). We switched from using nested queries to creating 
			temporary tables and then joining
			<br/>
			them appropriately, and this reduced the time to run to between two and 15 
			seconds each. We deleted (using code)
			<br/>
			each of the temporary tables following each batch and averaged about five 
			batches per day, and did not
			<br/>
			experience much database growth due to the use of these temporary tables."</p>
<p>"I have developed many very large databases and have always got excellent 
			results (includes real-time
			<br/>
			applications such as reporting train locations for all trains in country area 
			of New South Wales). Having
			<br/>
			started developing database applications in 1972, I am astounded at the stupid 
			way people go about designing
			<br/>
			systems today -- they don't understand how to do a lot with a little (including 
			comms rates of 300 baud). Access
			<br/>
			97 is infinitely more powerful than the mainframes I used to work on, and is 
			infinitely more stable. So let's cut
			<br/>
			the crap about Access being a toy and forcing people to use SQL Server or 
			Oracle. I haven't found anything I
			<br/>
			can't do better with Access than other programmers working on 'industrial 
			strength' databases."</p>
<p>"I am wondering why Access cannot go larger than 2GB or handle more users? 
			Is Microsoft trying to force us to a
			<br/>
			more expensive product? I do a lot of rapid development, and SQL Server is just 
			not fast enough to develop in. In
			<br/>
			addition, I cannot find the speed advantage using SQL Server. When running a 
			query off a two million record
			<br/>
			table and performing summation in the query, there was only a two-sec 
			difference in speed. For the majority of
			<br/>
			applications, Access is more than enough database. Sometimes you have to link 
			several databases together to
			<br/>
			handle the number of records you need, but that is not a big deal."</p>
<p>"In process right now. Replication gets worse as the size (both number of 
			objects AND amount of data) of the
			<br/>
			database grows. Also the larger the number of objects, the more strange things 
			happen. Example when adding a new
			<br/>
			record, the Memo field won't hold more than 1,500 characters, but previous 
			records hold 4,000 characters
			<br/>
			(yes, we have done the rebuild, compact, compress, held our collective breath, 
			and most recently waited to do
			<br/>
			these things until the proper phase of the moon was upon us). And, of course, 
			the stability of the MDB (mostly
			<br/>
			with Access 97) continues to degrade the larger the front-end database gets. 
			And we are not talking about
			<br/>
			near one-gig in size."</p>
<p>"I find it a bit weird that every time I make a small change to the 
			database design, the database size grows by
			<br/>
			some Mbs. I mostly configure Access to compact the dbase when closing Access, 
			but why is this an option? I would
			<br/>
			rather say it's a must!!"</p>
<p>"The problem with large databases in Access is that routine activities -- 
			especially queries -- may take
			<br/>
			hours to complete compared to seconds in other database products such as Visual 
			FoxPro."</p>
<p>"Pushing a million rows over a network was NOT a good idea..."</p>
<p>"My current database has 1,341 objects (61 local tables, 60 linked tables, 
			879 queries, 75 forms, 178 reports, 10
			<br/>
			macros, 78 modules). Compiled and compressed, it occupies 20 Mbytes. It is a 
			front-end analysis and reporting
			<br/>
			package for accounts data read through ODBC, so it has no significant data 
			storage (just a few megs of
			<br/>
			configuration data). I am worried that I am approaching Access's limitations 
			but have no way of predicting when I
			<br/>
			will hit 'the wall.' I am very pleased with the way it has coped so far." 
			Many of you apparently prototype in Access but then
			<br/>
			switch to an SQL Server or Oracle backend for production. I note that some of 
			you switch when data is at 10MB, some
			<br/>
			at 100MB, some at 500MB or more.
		</p>
<p>Now for this month's survey: I've been asked by the Access team at Microsoft to 
			do another survey to help
			<br/>
			them with future directions for the product. Congratulations! You folks have 
			become a valued source of
			<br/>
			opinions. This time around, the topic is reporting -- what do you like about 
			Access reports, and what's
			<br/>
			missing? Come over to http://www.larkfarm.com/sax/survey.asp to participate.
			<br/>
			I'll be giving away a copy of ACCESS 2002 ENTERPRISE DEVELOPER'S HANDBOOK to 
			one random respondent.
			<br/>
			Congratulations, by the way, to Jan Borup Coyle, who was the random winner from 
			last month. But wait; there's
			<br/>
			more! Because this is an "official" survey, Microsoft is going to 
			throw in one copy of MapPoint 2002 for every 75
			<br/>
			respondents. See you there!</p>

			4) A DEVELOPER'S BOOKSHELF: WRITING SECURE CODE<br/>
			---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			WRITING SECURE CODE, by Michael Howard and David LeBlanc (Microsoft Press, 
			2002)
		</p>
<p>This book contains not a single line of Access code, or even of VBA. 
			Nevertheless, I think it's essential reading
			<br/>
			for developers in this security-conscious age. Once you get over giggling at 
			the proximity of "Microsoft" and
			<br/>
			"Secure," you'll find that this is quite a good book from a pair of 
			guys who have put in much time trying to help
			<br/>
			teams at Microsoft write more secure code.</p>
<p>The book takes a solid technical look at things like writing security-conscious 
			C++ code, the right and wrong
			<br/>
			way to implement cryptography, and protecting against denial of service 
			attacks. But even if you're not going
			<br/>
			to twiddle books at this level, the "security first" philosophy 
			preached by this book is worth absorbing. It
			<br/>
			really does boil down to a few simple things: think about security, ship in a 
			secure state by default, and stay in
			<br/>
			touch with the field. But it's the details that will kill you, and those 
			details are well-covered here.</p>
<p>If you write code that ships to customers, read this book.</p>
<p>(Got a favorite software book of your own that you'd like to see in this space? 
			Let me know, and perhaps I'll cover
			<br/>
			it in a future issue!)</p>

			IN THE MAY ISSUE OF SMART ACCESS...<br/>
			---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			Have you tried our monthly print newsletter, SMART ACCESS? Here's just one of 
			the articles you'll find in
			<br/>
			the current issue. You can check it out (and learn more about SMART ACCESS) at
			<br/>
			http://www.smartaccessnewsletter.com.</p>
<p>You'll find a variety of articles from the print newsletter on the Web site. 
			Right now, for example, you
			<br/>
			can read Danny Lessandrini's "Create XML Web Reports from Access 
			2002," showing how you can use new methods in
			<br/>
			Access 2002 together with the power of XSL to publish data to the Web.</p>

<a name="SSWAccessReporter"></a><b>5) LEVERAGE ACCESS REPORTS INTO IIS</b><br/>
						---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
						SSW Access Reporter offers a new way to re-use Access reports on the Web 
						without a lot of recoding, and with decent speed. Newly-rewritten in .NET, this 
						utility supplies a report server and some objects that you can call from 
						ASP.NET Web pages. The Web pages talk to the Report Client, which uses .NET 
						remoting to talk to the Report Server, which might be running on another 
						computer on your local network.</p>
<p>The utility supports a variety of formats, including HTML, Access Snapshot, and 
						(if you have the appropriate bits from Adobe) PDF. You can use any Access 
						database or project, and you don't have to modify the database; you just tell 
						the Reporter utility which databases it's allowed to use for reporting.</p>
<p>
					If this sounds useful to you, you can get more details from SSW's Web site at 
					/ssw/AccessReporter/. The site includes an online demo, so you can get an idea 
					of the output that it'll produce. List price is $199. That's low enough that 
					this one should easily pay for itself if you're moving a bunch of reports to 
					the Web.

			7) LITESPEED BACKUPS FOR SQL SERVER<br/>
			---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			SQL LiteSpeed is a new software package designed with one thing in mind: fast 
			backups to disk of SQL Server 7.0 or
			<br/>
			2000 databases. Implemented as a set of extended stored procedures with a 
			syntax very similar to existing SQL
			<br/>
			Server back-up commands, SQL LiteSpeed compacts data as it's being backed up. 
			This means that backups take up
			<br/>
			less disk space, but, more importantly in many cases, it means that they can be 
			completed sooner. If you're
			<br/>
			dealing with large, active databases, that can be a significant benefit.</p>
<p>There are other great features here as well: cluster support, instance support, 
			actual 128-bit encryption for
			<br/>
			back-up files (native backups contain all of your data in clear text), and less 
			blocking of database operations
			<br/>
			that are going on at the same time as the backup. I could've really used this 
			one when I was working with the
			<br/>
			giant online database last year, where we did backups in the middle of the 
			night and just prayed that not too many
			<br/>
			users would be affected. Data compression (on the order of eight to one or 
			better, depending on the data) is a
			<br/>
			nice bonus here as well.</p>
<p>You'll find the SQL LiteSpeed Web site at 
			http://www.sqllitespeed.com/slsdefault.asp, where you
			<br/>
			can download a 15-day trial version. Pricing starts at $495 for a version that 
			supports databases up to 5GB.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			8) KB ARTICLE: BIND DAPs TO XML<br/>
			---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			The full title of MSKB article Q281863 is "HOW TO: Bind a Data Access 2002 
			Page to XML." Given the increasing
			<br/>
			ubiquity of XML in our lives, that seems like a pretty good thing to get a 
			handle on. The article shows you two
			<br/>
			different techniques. One binds the DAP to embedded XML (also called an XML 
			Data Island). The other binds the
			<br/>
			page to an external XML file. If you're using XML at all, you can probably 
			think of reasons why you need to know
			<br/>
			this. If not, you might want to play with the techniques here and see whether 
			they spark any interest. You can
			<br/>
			only hide from XML for so long...</p>
<p>(You can read this article online at 
			http://support.microsoft.com/Default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q281863.)</p>
<p>If you're using Internet Explorer 5.0 or above, and you're in the USA or Canada, 
			just type "MSKB 281863" into
			<br/>
			the address bar and hit Enter. After a bit of churning around, the browser 
			should be showing you the Knowledge
			<br/>
			Base article.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			9) TIP: WHEN IS A CHANGE NOT A CHANGE?
			<br/>
			---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			If you open a database created by one version of Access in another version 
			(say, opening an Access 97 database in
			<br/>
			Access 2002), you'll be warned that you can't change any objects in the 
			database unless you convert the database
			<br/>
			to the new format. It turns out that that's only part of the story. If all you 
			want to do is see the results of an
			<br/>
			ad-hoc query, go ahead and open the database without converting it. Then open 
			any existing query in design
			<br/>
			view. You can make any changes you like to this query, including removing or 
			adding tables, and run it to see
			<br/>
			the data. You just can't save the changes. But, if you're just hunting for 
			data, this is a lot faster than
			<br/>
			converting the database first.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			10) READER MAIL<br/>
			---------------------------------------------------------<br/>
			Ken Pearce wrote to follow up on his question from last time:</p>
<p>
			I was able to resolve the Link and Import issues by following the guidance from 
			Knowledge Base article
			<br/>
			Q242218: "Nothing happens when you try to start a Microsoft Access 
			Wizard."</p>
<p>
			By carefully uninstalling and reinstalling both versions (several times) on 
			both computers, I was
			<br/>
			finally able to resolve the issue by "stumbling" across the Windows 
			Installer Shortcut option
			<br/>
			suggested in the KB article. (When I first read that option, I thought they 
			must be joking!) Apparently,
			<br/>
			once both versions were installed with the "proper" shortcuts from 
			their respective program groups (as
			<br/>
			per the article), all features worked fine. It's not like I had a choice of how 
			to create the shortcut in
			<br/>
			the program group during the installation. Or did I? Go figure?!?</p>
<p>Julie Seiger writes with a warning of a serious bug that has bitten people from 
			time to time:</p>
<p>
			Here's a good Microsoft article for you to check out -- Q304548! I recently had 
			Visio 2002 loaded on my
			<br/>
			PC. The rest of my Office products are 2000. I was copying and pasting object 
			in Access 2000 and then
			<br/>
			closed the database. The next day, I opened it and got the following message 
			when I tried to get to the
			<br/>
			code window: "Error accessing file. Network connection may have been 
			lost." After researching the
			<br/>
			problem at the Microsoft Web site, I found that Visio 2002, and other members 
			of the Office XP family,
			<br/>
			update the Vbe6.dll to version 6.3.91.8. If this version of the .dll exists on 
			your machine and you
			<br/>
			copy objects in Access and close the database before you compile, your database 
			will be ruined. According
			<br/>
			to the article, "At this point, you have to revert to a known good back-up 
			copy of the database." Not a
			<br/>
			very pretty bug!</p>
<p>Isaac Mosseri writes with a problem to which I don't have the answer. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
			I have tried to print a report containing both text tables and pictures on a 
			Xerox 750 and Canon 6100 jet
			<br/>
			color printers, and, in both of them, I don't receive the printed material in 
			the same colors as I see in
			<br/>
			the preview screen. Most of them were black or sometimes red mixed with black 
			monocolor.</p>
<p>
			I tried in same places with the same printer drivers to print the printer test 
			page or a Word document and receive the right colors.</p>
<p>
			Is there a way to print in color from Access??</p>
<p>Gustav Brock passes on some experiments with the Nz() function:</p>
<p>
			Did you know that -- when used to return an expression in a query -- Nz() 
			always returns a string
			<br/>
			even if it's supposed to not do so?</p>
<p>
			Like this:</p>
<p>
			Expr1: Nz([fldNumeric])</p>
<p>
			or:</p>
<p>
			Expr1: Nz([fldNumeric], 0)</p>
<p>
			If you need a numeric value, you'll have to wrap it
			<br/>
			in Int():</p>
<p>
			NumExpr1: Int(Nz([fldNumeric]))</p>
<p>
			Even if fldNumeric is a long, this will return a long when fldNumeric is not 
			Null but an integer for Null.
			<br/>
			If you wish a long in any case, the zero for Null values for some reason must 
			be present:</p>
<p>
			NumExpr1: Int(Nz([fldNumeric], 0))</p>
<p>
			Alternatively, Nz() can be replaced with the good old
			<br/>
			IIf() construction:</p>
<p>
			NumExpr1: IIf(IsNull([fldNumeric]), 0,[fldNumeric])</p>
<p>
			This is tested for Access 95, 97 and 2000. Don't know about 2002.</p>
