            <h3>Silverlight</h3>
            <p>Silverlight is a powerful development platform for creating rich media applications and business applications for the Web, desktop, and mobile devices.</p>
            <p>Silverlight applications can be developed quickly with the Microsoft Web Platform Visual Studio, and Expression Studio.</p>
            <p>Silverlight applications are 'run' in a browser using a Silverlight plug-in. The plug-in is a free download and works across multiple browsers, devices and operating systems.</p>
            <p>Based on the Microsoft .NET framework, Silverlight has extensive layout and styling options, powerful communication protocols, robust data access, and support for user interaction and high-definition media.</p>
            <h3>Windows 8</h3>
            <p>Windows 8 takes advantage of the solid core of Windows 7 speed and reliability in an all-new touch interface. It's a new Windows for new devices. And it's ready to try now.</p>

        <h3>Silverlight 4</h3>
        <p>Silverlight 4 is the latest version of Silverlight - released by Microsoft in April 2010.</p>
        <p>With its productive developer tools and comprehensive designer tools, Silverlight allows businesses to develop line of business applications and web sites that are both highly functional and beautiful to use.</p>
        <p>Designers typically use Microsoft Blend to design the User interfaces whilst developers use Microsoft Visual Studio to write the functional code.</p>
    
        <h3>Windows 8</h3>
        <p>SSW provides a complete support to Windows 8, starting with setting up the development environment for your first application; We also cover the user interface design, touch-driven design elements, debug and deployment of your application.</p>
        <p>Experience now the Windows 8 system.</p>

        <h2><a name="CaseStudies"></a>Case Studies</h2>
        <p>SSW has been designing Silverlight based applications since version 2, including enterprise rostering solutions and company asset management LOB applications.</p>
        <p>SSW designed and developed a complete rostering system for a major Australian utilities company, built in Silverlight. With up to 1000 daily users, the application is a high performance system and has been through numerous iterations based on user feedback. The interface is clean and simple to use. Due to the ease with which designers and developers work together using Silverlight, changes and updates to the system have been developed and released to the client rapidly.</p>

        <p>Microsoft has numerous other <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/case-studies/"> Silverlight based case studies</a> to browse, including details of Silverlight applications used in healthcare, legal and utilities.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2><a name="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h2>
        <p>The system is able to be modified and deployed rapidly due to the streamlined deployment capabilities of Silverlight. A simple 'package' (file) of the updates is released to a central server, and all users are automatically updated with the new package.</p>
        <h3>Business Benefits</h3>
        <p>Businesses have started deploying Silverlight applications as part of their line of business (LOB) application platforms. Silverlight can be used to build entire apps, as well as packages included in an existing application (e.g. an existing web site).</p>
        <h3 class="accordionHeader">Offline Capability</h3>
        <p>Due to its out-of-browser capabilities, Silverlight provides offline functionality to users. Users can enter information into the applications and have it automatically synchronized when access is restored.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2><a name="Integration"></a>Integration</h2>
        <p>A key benefit of Silverlight is the ability to incorporate Silverlight into other platforms, including web sites, SharePoint and Office.</p>
        <h3>SharePoint Integration</h3>
            <p>Silverlight has proven itself to be a very efficient tool for building functionality into SharePoint parts for SharePoint based sites and intranets.</p>
            <p>SharePoint 2010 (released later this year) furthers the tight integration with Silverlight. By developing key business components in Silverlight, companies are efficiently enabling use of these objects in both standalone apps and integrated into SharePoint projects.</p>
        <h3>Office Integration</h3>
            <p>Silverlight parts can also be included in Office applications such as data and charting modules in Word and Excel.<br /><br /></p>
        <h3>Website Integration</h3>
            <p>Silverlight parts are extremely useful and simple to incorporate into web sites. They are particularly appropriate for adding rich media into existing sites.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="section">
        <h2><a name="Migration"></a>Migration</h2>
        <p>Silverlight is ideal for migrating/updating legacy systems including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Microsoft Access applications</li>
            <li>Existing LOB systems</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2><a name="Capability"></a>SSW Capability</h2>
        <p>SSW consultants are typically engaged on Silverlight projects to achieve the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rapid development of line-of-business (LOB) application parts</li>
            <li>Migration of existing LOB applications from older technologies into Silverlight</li>
            <li>Migration of Access system into Silverlight</li>
            <li>Rich media integration into existing sites</li>
            <li>Improving workflow processes </li>
            <li>Increasing performance of existing system processes</li>
            <li>Reducing deployment headaches on deployment of application updates</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Windows 8 vs Silverlight</h3>
            <p>The cool part is that Windows 8 developers were able to take Silverlight codes and make a XAML-based Metro style app out of it with minimal code changes.</p>
            <p>Some Silverlight users were worried that the Windowns 8 App Store would only support HTML5, but clearly that's not the case. XAML has its place on Windows 8 as well.</p>
