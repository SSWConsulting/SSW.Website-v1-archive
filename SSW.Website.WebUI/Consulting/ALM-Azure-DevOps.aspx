            <h5>SSW has been developing software since 1990 and has perfected the art of delivering shippable code on budget and on time by using Agile techniques.</h5>
            <h5>We use Microsoft's Visual Studio application lifecycle management (ALM) tools to provide the backbone for delivering software continuously. SSW can help you leverage the power of these tools to make your developers, testers, and analysts work together efficiently. We also use TFS, Microsoft Azure DevOps (was VSTS), TeamCity, and Octopus Deploy to fix your deployments and improve your testing lifecycle.</h5>

                    <h4>Increase efficiency and quality</h4>
                    <p>With proper application lifecycle management mechanisms, all the requirements and specifications of the project will be clearly defined. As a result, the developer team can ensure that their product is effectively designed according to the requirements without wasting extra resources.</p>

                    <h4>Integrated source control</h4>
                    <p>As an important part of application lifecycle management, source control will help the development team keep track of every modification to the code. It allows the developers to compare previous versions of the code with the current one so that they can fix errors if a mistake is made.</p>

                    <h4>Clear view of the working process</h4>
                    <p>The application lifecycle management provides effective tracking of work items with check-in lists so that the development team can have a clear view of their working processes. It will also help the managers to adjust the workloads for different employees so that all team members are working as productively as they can.</p>
