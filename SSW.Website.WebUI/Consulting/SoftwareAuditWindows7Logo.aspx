            The Windows 7 logo program aims to help customers make better purchase decisions by identifying products via the "Compatible with Windows 7" logo that have passed Microsoft-designed tests for compatibility and reliability on Windows 7. For software publishers looking to build on Windows 7, the program provides partners not only increased visibility through marketing support but also tools to help partners deliver products that they, and their end-users, can be confident will "just work" on Windows 7.
            </p>
        <p>The new Windows 7 logo requirements are based on extensive analysis of error reports, input from domain experts and feedback from Microsoft’s OEM, ISV and IHV partners on the challenges they and their customers face.  The logo toolkit targets specific, commonly identified application issues to help partners deliver a product that is compatible and reliable on Windows 7.  Once in market, access to Windows built-in error reporting enables partners to monitor issues being experienced by their customers and respond pro-actively to improve their product.
