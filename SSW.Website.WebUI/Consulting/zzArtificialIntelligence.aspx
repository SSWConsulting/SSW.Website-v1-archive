            <h5>Machine learning is a multi-disciplinary subject involving many disciplines such as probability theory, statistics, approximation theory, convex analysis, and algorithm complexity theory. It specializes in how computers simulate or implement human learning behaviors to acquire new knowledge or skills and reorganize existing knowledge structures to continuously improve their performance.</h5>
            <h5>Machine learning is the core of artificial intelligence (AI), and it is the fundamental way to make computers intelligent. Its application spans all fields of Artificial Intelligence. AI mainly uses induction, synthesis rather than deduction.</h5>
            <h5>Machine learning and AI are two of the most exciting technologies shaping businesses today. They promote humanity's productivity and creativity.</h5>

                    <h4>INCREASE YOUR TEAM'S PRODUCTIVITY</h4>
                    <p>Repeated jobs are tedious and can be easily handled with the help of AI algorithms. They don't require much intelligence in between the process. Machines can think much faster than humans and can perform multi-tasking to obtain the best possible results. Replacing humans with AIs for some repetitive tasks can save a lot of money and time for different kinds of businesses.</p>

                    <h4>IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE</h4>
                    <p>With the development of natural language processing technology, AI is becoming stronger and stronger in processing human languages. With the help of artificial intelligence, communication between business and customers can be much more efficient and emotionally intelligent.</p>

                    <h4>GAIN INSIGHTS WITH EFFECTIVE DATA MINING</h4>
                    <p>Cloud-based AI apps are so advanced that they can quickly discover important information and relevant findings while processing big data. This gives businesses insights into previously undiscovered information, which provides them with a significant advantage in the marketplace. While processing this information, AI can provide your business with projected outcomes based on past data from your customer behaviour.</p>

                    <h4>IMPROVE DATA ACCURACY + SEE ERRORS MINIMIZED</h4>
                    <p>It helps companies to minimize their errors in procedures and it increases the chance of reaching higher accuracy with a greater degree of precision. Machines will repeatedly complete tasks and will learn from that, while humans can do the same and still have a high error level. Minimizing errors can also reduce your cost of waste.</p>

                    <p>Marketing analytics has seen a recent resurgence as data size and diversity continue to grow. The cloud has become a popular option for quickly and economically scaling compute power and data storage. AI can help you improve the consumer journey and change the way you attract and cultivate leads.</p>

                    <p>Artificial intelligence can work as assistants in daily work for humans 24/7. With such fast processing speed, AI can analyze a massive amount of data very quickly. Machines don't require frequent breaks and refreshments like human beings. They can be programmed to work for long hours and can perform the job continuously without getting tired, bored, or distracted.</p>
