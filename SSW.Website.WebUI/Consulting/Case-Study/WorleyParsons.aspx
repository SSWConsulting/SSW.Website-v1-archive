        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>WorleyParsons is one of the world's top engineering and project delivery companies.</p>
		<p>SharePoint was implemented extensively across their organization, but they were looking to extend the development to include their new public website. After a lengthy tendering process, WorleyParsons chose SSW to develop their new public website and it is now powered by SharePoint 2007. </p>

        <h2>We make complicated things simple</h2> 
		<p>The site and all components were to be reusable, so site templates, page layouts, content types and web parts were used extensively. This allows WorleyParsons employees with sufficient permissions to manage and maintain the website without requiring any assistance from developers.</p>

	<h2>Smooth Deployment via SSWpackage.exe</h2>
	<p>Migration between development, staging and production servers was simplified by using SharePoint packaging functionality and using the suite of STSADM commands to deploy the components. SSW developed a tool to simplify the addition of all components to the package, as this process can be time consuming and error prone.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.worleyparsons.com">www.worleyparsons.com</a> website has been released and is live to the public. Both the client and the development team were very satisfied with the result. The project was completed in 10 weeks and delivered in line with the customers requirements.</p>
