        <p>The Northern Sydney Institute, part of TAFE NSW, is one of Australia’s leading providers of vocational training and tertiary education.</p>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Many websites are needed for the Institute, with websites for the brand, international versions, and microsites for subdivisions.</p>
        <p>The websites require a lot of maintenance and constant content changes. Prior to SSW developing the Sitefinity solution, this was all done manually within a small IT team.<br />
        A CMS was desperately needed to allow subdivisions to update their sites and content directly (with an approval workflow).</p>

        <h2>Integration</h2>
        <p>North Sydney Institute have a corporate booking system that the website required integration with, allowing students to sign up for courses without having to go onto a campus to enrol.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.theapa.edu.au/" target="_blank">www.theapa.edu.au</a> website has been released and is live to the public. Both the client and the development team were very satisfied with the result. SSW are currently developing phase two of the website and integrating a shopping cart.</p>
