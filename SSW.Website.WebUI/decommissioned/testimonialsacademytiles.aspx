    <p>February 
        20, 1999 </p>
      <p>To Whom It 
        May Concern: </p>
      <p>Superior 
        Software for Windows </p>
      <p>It gives 
        me pleasure to provide the following testimonial regarding SSW and in 
        particular Adam Cogan with whom I had the majority of my dealings. </p>
      <p>Academy Tiles 
        is a leading ceramic tile business, importing ceramics, marble and glass. 
        We wholesale and also provide a unique architectural library of over 5000 
        samples for use by professional people. Our showroom and warehouse are 
        located separately. </p>
      <p>About 1995 
        we determined that our Dos based computer system was antiquated and would 
        not allow us to survive and prosper. Our information needs were very comprehensive 
        and growing. And so the search began. Academy Tiles commenced an Access 
        database development with another developer. After some considerable work 
        was done, I became dissatisfied with the work and approached Microsoft 
        for a recommended Access developer to assist me in completing the exercise. 
        </p>
      <p>And so we 
        were introduced to Adam Cogan and SSW. At this point we 
        had a client and job database. We still required invoicing, purchasing, 
        inventory and shipping. </p>
      <p>I did not 
        enjoy the first day's experience. Adam pulled no punches and was critical 
        of the quality of the database structure and work to date. And he proposed 
        to pull it apart and rebuild. I wasn't initially sold on the idea but 
        after several days I could see a picture emerging of : structure, preciseness, 
        integrity and efficiency. It was the system we had to have, regardless 
        of initial cost and we have not looked back. Quite frankly without Adam's 
        involvement we would have a clumsy inefficient system which was not easily 
        modifiable I spent many days working with him developing our system and 
        learning how to use Access. As a &quot;partially&quot; technical accountant 
        I learnt sufficiently enough to be able to readily modify and evolve our system. 
        I have also dealt with others at SSW like Ibrahim Qutish and Ross Donald 
        and they continue to support me with any code which is beyond me. In addition 
        the free generic updates from SSW are a real bonus. The generic functions 
        have extended my capabilities and minimised the amount of code required. 
        </p>
      <p>As an accountant 
        I am very pleased to have the flexibility of periods that don't roll over. 
        It allows us to adjust any incorrect invoices and re-issue with the need 
        to create credit notes. This keeps the paperwork down to a minimum, reducing 
        the confusion of an long paper trail. Queries are regularly rerun, accumulating 
        monthly sales statistics etc. These also reflect any prior period adjustments. 
        </p>
      <p>We stock take 
        as many times as we wish, currently six monthly and roll stock into an 
        opening balance. Because of this one precaution we build into prior &quot;period&quot; 
        transaction alterations is to prevent these changes if they are dated 
        prior to the last stock take. The system is very flexible and can be run 
        to suit any particular set of requirements. </p>
      <p>It is also 
        very user friendly and all our staff including management input their 
        own work. </p>
      <p>Our business 
        could never have achieved the level of volume and success it has without 
        our Access database. </p>
      <p>And our Access 
        database would not be what is without the involvement of Adam and his 
        friendly professional and innovative team. </p>
      <p>Without qualification 
        I can state that their design work, desire to share and willingness to 
        educate have made a substantial contribution to our business. </p>
      <p>Joe Zeaiter<br>
        Director </p>
