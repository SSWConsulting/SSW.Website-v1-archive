            is Rich-Client Development?</b> 
            <p>No! 
              It doesn't mean all our clients are in Fortune's Top 500!</p>
            <p>Rich-Client 
              Development is the technology we've been using for the last 10 years. 
              The interface (front-end) we use is normally Microsoft Visual Basic 
              or Access.</p>
            <p>In 
              terms of deployment, installation must take place on every machine 
              requiring the software. When 
              you need a new version, once again, you must run the Configuration program 
              on each machine. </p>
            <p>The 
              advantages of Rich-Client applications are faster development right 
              from the start, with simpler implementation of changes.</p>
            <p>Disadvantages 
              are &quot;dll hell&quot;, and the hassles 
              of client-side installation.</p>
