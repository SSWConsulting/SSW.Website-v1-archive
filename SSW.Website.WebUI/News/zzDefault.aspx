            <img src="/ssw/News/images/logo-old-and-new.png" border="0" alt="The SSW logo, old and new" />
            <p>We could have started afresh, but we chose to keep the original company colors and the core feel. Therefore the swoosh was kept, as this has become the iconic symbol of SSW. We introduced a set of 4 small squares to the design, each in a varying shade of our corporate colors. The squares also highlight that we mainly work with the Microsoft stack.</p>

                        (2000 to 2002). Ian Thatcher, Leader Deloitte Technology Fast 50 program says, &quot;To
                        rank on the Deloitte Technology Fast 50, companies must have an impressive level
                        of sustained revenue growth over a three-year period. SSW has proven to be one of
                        the fast-growth success stories in Australia, and we applaud their success and vision.&quot;</p>

            <h2>FEB 2000 - Microsoft Recognition</h2>
            <p>Adam Cogan, president of the Sydney .NET Users Group, has been appointed to one of only two local Microsoft Regional Director roles.</p>
            <p>In the voluntary role, which is not compensated by Microsoft, Adam will provide an important sounding board between the software giant and its developer community according to Nick Abbott, Product Manager of developer tools and the MS program at Microsoft Australia.</p>
            <p><i>"The role speaks a lot about Adam and his role in the developer community"</i> Abbott said. <i>"It's one thing to be a good developer, but it's another to be well known and respected within your community and Adam is rapidly gaining an international reputation."</i> The role involves travelling to Microsoft's Redmond campus every 6-12 months, and as such, Adam was quite excited by the possibilities.</p>
            <p><i>"This is the opportunity of a lifetime."</i> Adam said, adding that Regional Directors are generally privy to Microsoft software and directions before the rest of the developer community, which will assist in his numerous public speaking appearances and internal training of staff at SSW.</p>
            <p>Cogan is filling the role recently vacated by Dr Richard Hunter of Brisbane-based software developer, Fair Play, perhaps best known for software such as ‘The Cricket Analyst’ used by sports coaches and competitors. Australia's other Microsoft Regional Director is Brian Walsh, director of Praxa's .NET practice.</p>
            <p>Microsoft works with around 140 Microsoft Regional Directors worldwide.</p>

                        Westbus is Sydney's largest private bus company that serves the communities of Western
                        Sydney and the Hills District by providing local, city, school and charter bus services.

                    <p>
                        SSW developed Westbus' Charter Booking system to serve multiple concurrent users
                        based at the various Westbus depots which service the Western Sydney region. The
                        objective was to replace an existing DOS system, to automate quote calculation and
                        to integrate with Microsoft Great Plains Accounting for invoicing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application was developed as an ASP.NET intranet application using a 4 tier
                        design. The .NET Framework 1.1 was used in conjunction with SQL Server. The system
                        generates reports powered by Crystal Reports whilst being exportable to Adobe Acrobat
