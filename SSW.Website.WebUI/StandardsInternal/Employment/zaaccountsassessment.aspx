	<h2> Overview - Accounts Skills Assessement Test </h2>
<p>
	Do you have 2 hours now? Any candidate for the Accounts position is to undertake an Accounts Skills Assessment Test before coming in for an interview. 
	This is to ensure that you are competent in general administrative and management skills, can communicate with clients 
	effectively and are able to manage yourself and others if required.
</p>
<h2>Task 1 - Legal Correspondence </h2>
<p>
	Write a letter 
        to a solicitor Mr David le Page regarding signage. This is the information 
        you need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> We erected 
          an external illuminated sign </li>
        <li>Jackson 
          Wells complained</li>
        <li>Nobody 
          else has complained</li>
        <li>But Jackson 
          have and have 20% voting power</li>
        <li>Current By-law says we cant have an external illuminated sign</li>
        <li>Can you 
          draft us a motion to change the by-law so we can have our sign</li>
        <li>We believe 
          that Jackson Wells Morris will also be submitting a motion that seeks 
          to prohibit all signage on the building above street level. </li>
        <li>We are 
          happy to make alterations to the illuminated sign that was initially 
          erected, so that the majority of owners consider the sign appropriate. 
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Task 2 - Budget</h2>	
      <ul>
        <li>We need an SSW Budget that predicts 
          our annual income depending on our two income sources. The first 
		source is consulting work, and the second source is product sales.</li>
        <li>Create a spreadsheet called "July 2003 - June 2004" 
          which will have months on the x axis and developers names on the y axis</li>
        <li>Details about the number of developers, rates and billable 
          days can be found on the <a href="Accounts.xlsx" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>
