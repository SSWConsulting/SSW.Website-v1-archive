SSWRegistrationReset is to be used only when a user complains that they are getting a 'tinkering with the registry' error on the first attempt to use the software.
 
To use this you will need to get the SSWRegistrationReset code from SourceSafe and replace the product name with the name of your product.
 
This will indicate the Registry value so for Performance PRO it would be 'SOFTWARE\SSW\SSWPerformancePRO'.
