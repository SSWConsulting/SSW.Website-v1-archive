			<h2>Stephen Bennett - About Me</h2>

		<p>
			Hi, I'm 26, live in Manly with some friends of mine.&nbsp; I'm 
			starting with SSW as Adam Cogan's Personal Assistant and the 
			Administration Manager for the company.&nbsp; To give you a bit of 
			insight as to who I am, I have been working in a few different roles 
			since finishing Year 12 in 1996.&nbsp; During my colourful 9 years in 
			the work force, I've worked in varied companies such as Credit Unions, 
			Banks, Recruitment Agencies, IT companies, Donut Shops (don't ask), 
			Abattoirs (again don't ask), Music Shops, Stunt Agencies, TV &amp; Film 
			Productions and Stock Market Education.&nbsp; Primarily, I've worked in 
			Customer Service roles, however in the past few years I've worked in a 
			Personal and Executive Assistant capacity.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I really in enjoy spending time with friends and making new ones.&nbsp; 
			I'm currently, just about to complete a short film course and in my 
			spare time enjoy going to see Concerts, Plays and Short Film Festivals.&nbsp; 
			I enjoy being social and one day I hope to be an Assistant Director on a 
			TV Series, or be a TV Host for my own show.
		</p>
		<p>I look forward to meeting you all soon.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>My favourite quote is &quot;don't be afraid to REINVENT YOURSELF&quot;.</p>
