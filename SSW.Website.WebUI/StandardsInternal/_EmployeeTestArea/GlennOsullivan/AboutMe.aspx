                Why am I here?</h3>
            I plan to do as much as I can to be a valuable member of the team, with a view to learn as much as I can about software development.<br />
        </li>
        <li><H3>What am I interested in?</H3>
            In IT I'm obviously interested in coding, but also security. I'd like to have the skills to write software that implements encryption algorithms and authentication. I'm also a big music and rugby union fan.
