				<div>
					I have just finished 4 years at the University of Sydney including doing honours doing my final year.
					The course completed was a Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology. I studied a number of different courses
					covering topics in databases, OO design, user interface design, programming in numerous languages including Java,
					C, C++, C#, Python (a little), HTML, and Javascript (a little).

				<div>
					I'm a keen surfer so I try to spend any time I have down at the beach - now that I'm working full time though there
					may be a problem! Being a surfer has sort of shaped who I am; I feel that I'm an easy going, social person. I am
					honest and hard working, but I get frustrated when things that I'm working on aren't completed to the best of my
					ability.

				<div>
					My other hobbies/sports that I enjoy include skiing, scuba diving, and caving.

				<div>
					While at uni I was a casual tutor for the IT department. I took first year programming courses in both semesters as 
					well as second year course about computer system organisation (some lower level type stuff) and a third year user 
					interface design course.
