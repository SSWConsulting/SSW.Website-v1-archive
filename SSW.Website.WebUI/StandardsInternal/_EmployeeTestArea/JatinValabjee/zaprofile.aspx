					I graduated from UTS in 2002 with a Bachelor of Computing Science. I am hoping to enroll in an MBA in the next few years. I am a keen software developer looking to improve my .NET and database knowledge.<BR><BR>

				<div>
					I love spending time with friends, and making new ones. I love going to the gym and keeping fit. I've recently found a love for the outdoors - I love camping trips and long pointless drives - if I'm in good company. I'm easy to get along with and very reliable.<BR><BR>

					I worked throughout university designing and developing various web applications and data-driven e-commerce sites. I worked at a small IT company for the better part of 2003, and joined SSW in 2004.<BR><BR>
