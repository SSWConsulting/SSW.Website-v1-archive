			I hail from the Sunshine Coast where I completed my schooling which included a</br>
			Bachelor of Business in Information Systems from the University of the Sunshine Coast.</br>
			I have had varied work experience before commencing my studies and have travelled</br>
			extensively through much of Indonesia.</p>
			My employment at SSW began on Monday the 17th of November as the Administration Manager;</br>
			SSW appears to be a dynamic company at the forefront of Microsoft Technology and I believe</br>
			there is much that I can and will learn throughout my employment.</p>
