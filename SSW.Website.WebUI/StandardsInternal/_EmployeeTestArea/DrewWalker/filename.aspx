		<p>I guess I should start by introducing myself: my name is Drew and I'm 
		20 years old. I lived in Terrigal on the Central Coast for the first 18 
		years of my life until I graduated from high school in 2001, at which 
		time I moved to Sydney.</p>
		<h2>Experiences</h2>
		<p>From January to July 2004 I was living and traveling in the US. I was 
		based in Newport Beach, California and was fortunate enough to visit 
		Chicago, the Florida Keys, Miami and Yosemite National Park. The 
		highlight of the trip had to be snorkeling on Alligator Reef in the 
		Florida Keys.</p>
		<p>The trip was completed with a 4 week stay in the UK that included a 
		whirlwind tour of Ireland, visiting family in the north of England and 
		going a little crazy for a few nights in London.</p>
		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>My high school years were spent at Gosford High School (years 7-10) 
		and Central Coast Grammar School (years 11 &amp; 12).</p>
		<p>During school I was involved in a lot of sporting teams, including 
		water polo, track &amp; field, basketball, cricket, tennis and rugby. Since 
		school I have only kept up basketball and played for the North Sydney 
		Bears youth league team in 2002. Each year since high school I have also 
		played in an amateur basketball competition in Chicago for a team from 
		Los Angeles.</p>
		<p>In 2002 I began studying a Bachelor of Computing with a major in 
		Business Systems. I am doing the degree part time by correspondence 
		through Monash University in Gippsland, Victoria.</p>
		<h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
		<p>On my recent trip to the US and UK I caught the travel bug, so now 
		one of my future aspiration aspiration is to see the rest of the world 
		(as much of it as possible!) and spend some time working overseas in the 
		US or Europe.</p>
		<p>I also would like to continue playing basketball and play a season 
		for an ABA team.</p>
