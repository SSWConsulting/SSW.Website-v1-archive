			<h3>Introduction</h3>My name is Michael Mileos, and I'm and eXtreme 
			kind of guy. My favourite activities include skateboarding, rocking 
			out on my guitar, watching movies, clubbing with friends, moshing at 
			concerts, and of course - Developing Software. My taste in music 
			ranges from Hard Rock to Dance to Trance and then to R 'n B.&nbsp; I 
			also like to travel and have lived in New York, frequented Athens, 
			and have visited London, Canada, Japan, and most recently, The 
			Kingdom of Bahrain (in transit). <br><br></li>

			<h3>Education</h3>In year 8, at Inaburra High School, I encountered 
			my first very first programming language - QBASIC. While I found it 
			interesting, it was not until year 10 that I began using Visual 
			Basic and was truly drawn into programming. I made many fun 
			little programs, ranging from Joke Applications to an Internet Chat 
			Program with basic encryption, and this was just for fun in my spare 
			time. I also enjoyed making homepages, and had designed a fan site 
			for my favorite music artist, at the time, Tupac Shakur. I took 3U 
			Computing Studies and graduated high school in 1998.<br><br>I then had an 
			opportunity to complete higher education in New York, and so.. I 
			took it! While studying at the City University of New York's College 
			of Staten Island (<a href="http://www.csi.cuny.edu">CSI</a>), I 
			completed two degrees: An Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) in 
			Computer Programming, and a Bachelor of 
			Science in Computer Science. I completed both of these degrees with 
			honors, and as well as being on the Dean's list, I also received 
			scholarships for most of my years (after becoming a New York 
			resident). My studies at CSI saw me spending most of my time in C++; however, we used some VB and Java as well.<br><br></li>

			<h3>Future Aspirations</h3>Who knows what the future brings? In the future I aspire to be "Happy."
			
			Ideally I would like to be developing software at a higher level, 
			and making lots of money would be good too.<br><br></li>
