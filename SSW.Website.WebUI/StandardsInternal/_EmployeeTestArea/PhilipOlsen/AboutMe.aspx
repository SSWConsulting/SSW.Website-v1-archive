                Why am I here?</h3>
            I am currently studying in a Bachelor of I.T. degree at UTS. As a part of my degree
            I am completing a 6 month industry placement here at SSW.<br />
        </li>
        <li><H3>What am I interested in?</H3>
            I'm interested in everything IT, but particularly IT security (hackers, Intruder
            Detection Systems and IT forensics) and gadgets (smartphones, etc). I.T. aside,
            I'm also into socialising with my mates and having a few beers and a game of pool
            at the local.
