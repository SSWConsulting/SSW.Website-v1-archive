                Objective</h3>
            I graduated from UNSW major in Human Resources Management in 2004 and worked in
            Newtech, a Telstra dealer, as Personal Assistant for 2 years. I went travelling
            in Hong Kong, China and Thailand last few months. Now, I come back and look for
            new challenges. I believe I will learn by working in a total different industry,
            IT industry. Also to improve my communication and management skills.
