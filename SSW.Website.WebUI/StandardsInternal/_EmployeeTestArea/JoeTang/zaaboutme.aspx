		<p>
			Hi there, here's something about me....</p>
		<p>
			I am the Marketing Manager for SSW, and am always looking forward to 
			implement marketing strategies for the company. I will be 
			concentrating on the product side of SSW.&nbsp; My experiences are 
			mainly in the IT industry &amp; Telecommunications industry. I've had 
			quite a varied marketing career, mainly in communications, product 
			management as well as strategic marketing analyst.</p>
		<p>
			Instead for boring you further with the usual stuff, let me tell you 
			more about Joe as a person....</p>
		<p>
			My personality is that I like to be doing things, (work or pleasure) 
			if I am not doing something then I get bored &amp; fall asleep (arrrghh!!! 
			I have no control.....) I have something against standing in cues, 
			traffic lights, or just anything that requires me to wait. I come 
			across as moody and reserved, but I can really open and make a total 
			&amp; utter fool of myself with the right atmosphere..... (probably why 
			I stay quiet most of the time.)
		</p>
		<p>
			My interest are:</p>
		<p>
			I am into boating, fishing.... I am a certified diver and love 
			anything to do with the sea.
		</p>
		<p>
			I love to paint and draw imaginative stuff...... probably comes from 
			my great love of books.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the risk of sounding like a certified nerd, I like to play chess 
			&amp; strategic style games, though if you play chess with me you'd most 
			likely win. I quite hopeless at it, but hey, its true love!
		</p>
		<p>
			I also enjoy a sport call Brazillian Juijitsu, but finding a dojo in 
			a convenient area is a little difficult.... they are sooooo rare!!!</p>
		<p>
			I am a dog person as oppose to cats - but no; I don't have a dog, I 
			have fish instead (go figure.)</p>
		<p>
			Above all, I like to learn new skills and experience new sensations. 
			I am always in a habit of trying out new stuff.</p>
