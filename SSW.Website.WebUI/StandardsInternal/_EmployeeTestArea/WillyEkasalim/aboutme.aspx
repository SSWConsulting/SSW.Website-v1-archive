		<h2>Willy Ekasalim - About Me</h2>
	
		<p>My 
name is Willy and I am 4th year Software Engineering student at UNSW. 
During this winter university break, I am joining SSW as work experience intern 
for approximately around 4 weeks. I have done internship before in software 
development area in which I was working as a J2EE framework researcher. My area 
of interest is on E-Commerce application, and my University�s thesis and course 
selection are mainly focusing on that area. I have been gaining interest on .NET 
technology as one of the leading E-Commerce implementation technology in the 
business. SSW�s experience in .NET technology and its extensive range of product has 
attracted me to apply for this opportunity.</p>
	
		<p>Hopefully I will be able to contribute as much as I will be able to learn in SSW. Cheers...
