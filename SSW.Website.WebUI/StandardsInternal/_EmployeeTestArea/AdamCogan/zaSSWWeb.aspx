			New web pages are to be consistent with the SSW Template. All new pages must also abide by 
			the rules set out in <a href="/SSW/Standards/default.aspx#WebSiteRules">SSW Rules to 
			Better Websites</a>. 
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
			Please also read the standard on <a href="/SSW/StandardsInternal/InductionTraining/InductionDay1.aspx">
			SSW Branding</a> before you create a new page...

			<h2>Sample Heading to look like this</h2>

		<p>
		<li>
		<p>

			You should acknowledge any contributers in accordance with standard convention. 
			If you are quoting another author directly you should use direct quotes - for 
			example: As Cameron Shaw says in the SSW Web Template &quot;You should 
			acknowledge any contributers&quot;. OR, if you are just referring to another 
			persons idea don't quote the author directly, but mention that it is his idea - 
			for example: Adam Cogan recommends on his site (<a href="/ssw/">www.ssw.com.au</a>) 
			that every coding company should have a series of rules and standards that 
			every developer must adhere to.&quot; Following this standard will ensure we 
			don't get accused of plagiarism.
