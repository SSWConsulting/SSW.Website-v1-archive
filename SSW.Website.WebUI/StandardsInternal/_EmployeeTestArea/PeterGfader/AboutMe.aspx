            <p>
                I completed my degree in Computer Science at the Technical University of Vienna
                Austria (Europe) in 2004 and have more recently completed some Microsoft certifications.

                Former employment</h2>
            <p>
                During my studies I have worked part time as a software developer for Atos Origin
                Austria, where I have mainly drawn up and managed Oracle databases.
                <br />
                In addition I programmed the ASP (VB script) pages for the respective databases
                and created prototype web pages in HTML and JavaScript.
                <br />
                <br />
                Back in South Tirol, Italy (Europe) I started to work as full time Software Developer
                at Informatica Alto Adige as a Winforms Developer with Oracle databases.<br />
