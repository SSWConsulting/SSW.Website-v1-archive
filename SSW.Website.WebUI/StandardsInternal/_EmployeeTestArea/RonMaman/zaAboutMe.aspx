		    <h2>Professional</h2>
		    Ron has been writing software for the past 8 years, and sees software writing as art.
		    
		    He thinks object-oriented is the best thing to happen to software development as it puts things into order.
		    
            Having worked with differet coding-languages, Ron finds C# as the best Microsoft language to develop with.
                        
            He believes in being honest to the business about realistic deliverables rather than asking for more time or money at the last minute, 
            as that tends to gets everyone involved upset and give him high stress.  
            
            Ron likes to lead by example and is not afraid of hard work.
