Don't edit these files directly.  

Instead:

0. You must have Visual Build Pro installed (find it on Bee).

1. get the latest version of UNICORN/SSW/extremeEmails/Trunk/Resources/Reports/*.xsl
 from TFS and make your changes there.

2. use the xsl files to generate reports in ExtremeEmails, save to .htm format.

3. Rename and update the .htm files to TFS.  Also edit default.aspx to reflect any changes.

4. right-click on your local copy of _deploytowebsite.bld.  Click Build.  This will synchronize with Ant.

5. any zz'd files and subfolders on TFS will not be copied over.

6. to revert to an older version, revert it on TFS and then run _deploytowebsite.bld again.
