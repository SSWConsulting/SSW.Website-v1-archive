Use the standard naming convention when creating new redirects.

eg 
If it is a Technical Link use the suffix "HotTip" 
If it is a MS Link use "MS" (a HotTip Ms link should be HotTipMS)
If it is an Event or conference link use "Event"
If it is a Newsletter link use the current suffix (YearMonth)
If it's to the home page of another company use "HomePage"
If it's from KB article to another source use "KBQ0000000UP"


NOTE: If you are redirecting to the Microsoft Knowledgebase default.aspx, or any page with semi colons in the URL, make sure you have single quotes around the URL path. 
This is beacause semicolons in the url interfere with the redirect meta tag.



Please do a text search in this directory for your new URL in case we
already have an existing redirect to it.
