			John the manager of a middle sized business, has found it annoying 
                trying to organize what tasks he should set his employees. There 
                always seems to be some employees with mountains of work and some 
                with next to none, wasting time and money. Because of this there 
                seems to be a slow turn around of work coming from employees.</p>
              <p>John 
                has discovered SSW Team Calendar and has set it up in the business. 
                John is now able to assign work to his employees and keep the 
                workload balanced because he can see what each employee is doing 
                and planning to do though SSW Team Calendar.</p>
              <p>Because 
                all employees are now working at the same pace, work turnaround 
                has increased dramatically.<br>
                <br>
                At any time John's employees can view, add, update, reallocate 
                tasks and calendar events all within Outlook OR though the web.

               Nicole 
                is a secretary of a busy business. When a client phones for a 
                person, she has to find out whether that person is in the office 
                or on-site quickly and easily. Previously this task would involve 
                walking around the office, asking employees whether they have 
                seen that person and where they are. Not only is this task time 
                consuming, but it also distracts the other staff in the office.</p>
              <p>With 
                SSW Team Calendar Nicole can pull up a employee within Team Calendar 
                and see whether they are in the office, currently busy, or available.
