                    This is one of the first academic course in the world to teach students on SQL SERVER
                    2008 for Business Intelligence. SQL Server 2005 blurs the lines between relational
                    and multidimensional databases. Data may be stored in the relational database, in
                    the multidimensional database, or the new Proactive Cache feature. One key feature
                    of SQL SERVER 2005 is that Analysis Services 2005 does not contain a metadata repository.

                    Microsoft SQL Server 2008 is a complete business intelligence (BI) platform that
                    provides the features, tools, and functionality to build both classic and innovative
                    kinds of analytical applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Business Intelligence components supports the development
