        <strong>Description</strong>
        <p>
            Written and presented by industry experts, this intensive five-day workshop gives professional developers the information 
        and hands-on experience they need to deliver state-of-the-art, integrated reporting and analytics solutions using Microsoft 
        Business Intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Delivering the right information in the right format at the right time to all users in the organization-that is Microsoft's 
        Business Intelligence (BI) strategy and vision for enterprise information management. Microsoft's integrated BI tools enable 
        developers to create effective solutions that information workers use every day to find meaningful patterns in the vast sea 
        of data they collect and to use that insight to quickly respond to changing business conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this workshop, attendees will be able to position different types of business intelligence solutions, from enterprise 
        data warehousing to data marts to real-time operational reporting and analytics. Attendees will learn how to design and build 
        powerful integrated solutions that provide users with rich reporting, analysis, visualization and performance management 
        capabilities by targeting operational data from an existing line-of-business application using the Microsoft Business Intelligence 
        platform. 
        </p>
        <p>Attendees will work through 25 practical hands-on labs to build a complete BI solution by the end of the workshop. </p>
        <strong>Course Summary</strong>
        <p>
            During this 5-day course, you will learn about integrating Integration Services, Analysis Services and Reporting Services 
        to build a business intelligence solution. When you complete this course, you will understand how to design, develop, deploy, 
        and operate a business intelligence solution that integrates data from an On-Line Transactional Processing (OLTP) into a SQL 
        Server Analysis Services (SSAS) cube and delivers reports to business users.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Integrate:</strong> Define, debug, deploy, manage and secure SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages 
            that extract, transform, and load data from an OLTP database into an SSAS cube and a relational data warehouse<br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Define, deploy, process, manage and secure SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) cubes, mining 
            models, dimensions, hierarchies, calculations, translations, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)<br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Report:</strong> Define, deploy, manage, and secure SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports that consume 
            data stored in SSAS cubes and in the relational data warehouse and deliver reports to business users.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This course will demonstrate a fully working end-to-end solution, including extensive demos, hands-on labs, sample projects 
        that will not only teach how to use the new technology, but also illustrate business intelligence and data warehouse best practices.

            SharePoint 2007 to many is a web version of Access. Come see Adam Cogan show you 
            how you have a lot of options including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>using SharePoint data in your Access solution</li>
            <li>using Access to report on your SharePoint data</li>
            <li>upsizing your access data to SharePoint and then continue with Access as the 
                frontend</li>
            <li>upsizing your entire Access solution to SharePoint and then finish using Access 
                as your platform</li>
        </ul>

                OK, so you know about how the new powerful reporting platform from Microsoft 
            will change the landscape of enterprise reporting. Come and see Sydney based SQL 
            Guru and MS Regional Director Adam Cogan show the developer features of this 
            latest addition to the Microsoft SQL Server family of products.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will see real world examples of this server-based platform when used for 
            creating, managing and delivering both traditional, paper-oriented reports and 
            interactive, Web-based reports. Reporting Services 2005 combines the data 
            management capabilities of SQL Server and Microsoft Windows Server with familiar 
            and powerful Microsoft Office System applications to deliver real-time 
            information to support daily operations and decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reporting Services makes viewing your data a breeze and SQL Server 2005 brings 
            database reporting to a whole new level. In this session, you will learn how to 
            take full advantage of the new Report Designer that is integrated into Visual 
            Studio 2005. We will discuss the core product improvements, reporting 
            improvements, the better integration and the richer developer experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Come and see Adam show the right and wrong ways to develop reports and show data 
            to users.
