                        <strong><a href="/ssw/Employees/EmployeesProfile.aspx?EmpID=AC">Adam Cogan</a> - Chief
                            Architect at SSW and Microsoft Regional Director</strong>. Adam has been developing
                        custom solutions for businesses across a range of industries such as Government,
                        banking, insurance and manufacturing since 1990 for clients such as Microsoft, Quicken,
                        and the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. His wealth of experience
                        in the industry and unsurpassed technical knowledge will ensure attendees get the
                        most out of these sessions.</p>
                    <p>
                        The promise of a successful project is something we all work harder to achieve ,
                        but working harder is not the answer. Software companies need to work smarter before,
                        during, and after development, to ensure that the client gets not only what they
                        want, but what they need.</p>
                    <p>
