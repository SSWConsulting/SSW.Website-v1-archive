        Visual Studio Ultimate (formerly Visual Studio Team System (VSTS)) and Team Foundation
        Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft .NET platform.
        These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful projects and for
        the developers to have a focused and smooth software development process.</p>
    <p>
        Come and see Adam Cogan, Microsoft Regional Director, VSTS Champ and Chief Architect
        from SSW show you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to successfully gather requirements with User stories</li>
        <li>The right want to use work items</li>
        <li>The way to complete a work items and send a "done"</li>
        <li>Use templates for your standard work items</li>
        <li>The extra work items that developers always forget</li>
        <li>What is good and bad about Excel and Project integration</li>
        <li>What you can use from the built in reporting as well as the Project portals available
            on from the SharePoint dashboard</li>
        <li>The important reports to give your Project Manager</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Walk away knowing how to see the project health and progress. Visual Studio Ultimate
        is designed to help address many of these traditional problems faced by project
        managers. It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to help teams improve
        their software development activities and to help project managers better support
        the software development processes.</p>
    <p>
        <p>
            During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating work items and tracking
            of releases using Visual Studio Ultimate and Team Foundation Server.</p>

            When working with databases, we often need to create some administrative pages to
            do all our CRUD operations on the tables. This can be a long and repetitive process
            if you don't use a code generator. Thankfully in VS 2008 SP1 Dynamic data allows
            us to create all those pages without writing a single line of code! In this session
            you will also find out how to customize these admin pages with different looks and

            of Reporting Services. Everyone who has an Exchange Server 2000/2003 should be reporting
            on it but nobody does. Following this, we will explore the creation of a real Reporting
            Services solution. You will learn about the important issues of security, data access,
            rendering, and delivery. We will also discuss the deployment issues of an application
            that requires Reporting Services. Sample code is provided so you can use this useful
