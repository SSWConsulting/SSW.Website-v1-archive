    <h3>Massively increase your output of work</h3>

    <p>To get the most out of Scrum, an organisation needs to have an appreciation for how the methodology works and who plays what role in making Scrum the success that it is, so SSW are now offering Professional Tailored Scrum Training, filling the gap in the Professional Scrum Developer and Professional Scrum Master training courses, which are targeted at specialised teams.</p>
    <p>The Professional Tailored Scrum Training is a unique and intensive experience for CEOs, Executives, Business Managers, Business Stakeholders, Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Software Developers, Testers and Architects. The course guides teams on how to turn product requirements into potentially shippable increments of software using the Scrum framework.</p>
    <p>Students learn through instruction and team-based exercises, and are challenged to think in terms of the Scrum principles to better understand what to do when returning to the workplace.</p>
    <p>Training can be tailored to deliver any or all of the course objectives below.  For example, you may have certified Professional Scrum Developers and Professional Scrum Masters within your organisation, in which case we can tailor a course targeting non-technical personal such as department managers, business stakeholders and executives.  Or your organisation may not have any Scrum expertise, in which case we can tailor a course to train Developers, Scrum Masters, Business Stakeholders, Executives and anyone else who may benefit, effectively bringing all parties within your organisation together, dispelling myths, giving a clear understanding of who does what and how Scrum will work for you.</p>
