    <p>
        This Professional Scrum Developer (PSD) course is a unique and intensive five-day
        experience for software developers. The course guides teams on how to turn product
        requirements into potentially shippable increments of software using the Scrum framework,
        Visual Studio 2013, and modern software engineering practices. Attendees will work
        in self-organizing, self-managing teams using a common instance of Visual Studio
        Team Foundation Server 2013 to achieve this goal.
    </p>
    <%--    <p>
        Scrum Developer (SD) training courses will teach attendees how to use modern software
        engineering practices to develop an increment of completed, potentially shippable
        functionality. They will be taught how to do so within the Scrum framework, working
        as part of self-organizing cross-functional teams, doing iterative, incremental
        development.</p>
    <p>
        SD workshops will be conducted by trainers that are skilled in development practices
        and tools within a Scrum context. These individuals are assessed, trained, mentored,
        and monitored by Scrum.org and training organizations as Scrum Developer Trainers.</p>
    <p>
        SD workshops are exercise driven. Attendees will work in teams and develop "done"
        increments from product backlog items. The workshops will be five days long. At
        the conclusion of a course, attendees will assess their knowledge and skills, the
        results of which will be mapped on the Scrum Knowledge chart for their own use.
        This will facilitate their ability to track their professional improvement throughout
        their careers.</p>
    <p>
        SD workshops are based on specific technology stacks. Initially, one will cover
        Microsoft .NET, and one will cover Java technologies. Others may be offered in the
        future. Teams will work hands-on, to deliver potentially shippable software in the
        respective technology.</p>--%>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
        This course is suitable for any member of a software development team - architect,
        programmer, database developer, tester, etc. Entire teams are encouraged to attend
        and experience the course together, but individuals are welcome too. Attendees will
        self-organize to form cross-functional Scrum teams. These teams require an aggregate
        of skills specific to the selected case study. Please see the last page of this
        document for specific details. Product Owners, ScrumMasters, and other stakeholders
        are welcome too, but keep in mind that everyone who attends will be expected to
        commit to work and pull their weight on a Scrum team.
    </p>

    <h2>What does the week look like?</h2>
    <p>
        This course is a mix of lecture, demonstration, group discussion, simulation, and
        hands-on software development. The bulk of the course will be spent working as a
        team on a case study application delivering increments of new functionality in mini-sprints.
        Here is the week at a glance:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img width="100%" src="/ssw/events/images/scrum-training-schedule.jpg" alt="What does the week look like?" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Monday morning and most of the day Friday will be spent with the computers powered
        off, so you can focus on sharpening your game of Scrum and avoiding the common pitfalls
        when implementing it.
    </p>

        The Sprints</h2>
    <p>
        Timeboxing is a critical concept in Scrum as well as in this course. We expect each
        team and student to understand and obey all of the timeboxes. The timebox duration
        will always be clearly displayed during each activity. Expect the instructor to
        enforce it.
        <br />
        Each of the 1/2 day sprints will roughly follow this schedule:

        Each team is expected to self-organize and manage their own work during the sprint.
        Pairing is highly encouraged. The instructor/product owner will be available if
        there are questions or impediments, but will be hands-off by default. You should
        be prepared to communicate and work with your team members in order to achieve your
        sprint goal. If you have development-related questions or get stuck, your partner
        or team should be your first level of support.

    <h3>
        Module 4: THE CASE STUDY</h3>
    <p>
        In this module the team is introduced to their problem domain for the week. A kickoff
        meeting by the Product Owner (the instructor) will set the stage for the why and
        what that will take during the upcoming sprints. The team will then define the quality
        attributes of the project and their definition of "done." The legacy application
        code will be downloaded, built, and explored, so that any bugs can be discovered
        and reported.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction to the case study</li>
        <li>Download the source code, build, and explore the application</li>

        <li>Define "done"</li>
        <li>How to file effective bugs in Visual Studio 2012</li>
        <li>Retrospective</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Module 5: HOTFIX</h3>
    <p>
        This module drops the team directly into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)">
            Brownfield</a> (legacy) experience by forcing them to analyze the existing application's
        architecture and code in order to locate and fix the Product Owner's high-priority
        bug(s). The team will learn best practices around finding, testing, fixing, validating,
        and closing a bug.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to use Architecture Explorer to visualize and explore</li>
        <li>Create a unit test to validate the existence of a bug</li>
        <li>Find and fix the bug</li>
        <li>Validate and close the bug</li>
        <li>Retrospective</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Module 6: PLANNING</h3>
    <p>
        This short module introduces the team to release and sprint planning within Visual
        Studio 2012. The team will define and capture their goals as well as other important
        planning information.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Release vs. Sprint planning</li>
        <li>Release planning and the Product Backlog</li>
        <li>Product Backlog prioritization</li>

        <li>Creating and linking Sprint tasks</li>
        <li>Retrospective</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        At this point the team will have the knowledge of Scrum, Visual Studio 2012, and
        the case study application to begin developing increments of potentially shippable
        functionality that meet their definition of done.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Module 7: EMERGENT ARCHITECTURE</h3>
    <p>
        This module introduces the architectural practices and tools a team can use to develop
        a valid design on which to develop new functionality. The teams will learn how Scrum
        supports good architecture and design practices. After the discussion, the teams
        will be presented with the product owner's prioritized backlog so that they may
        select and commit to the functionality they can deliver in this sprint.

    <h3>
        Module 8: TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT</h3>
    <p>
        This module introduces Test Driven Development as a design tool and how to implement
        it using Visual Studio 2012. To maximize productivity and quality, a Scrum team
        should setup Continuous Integration to regularly build every team member's code
        changes and run regression tests. Refactoring will also be defined and demonstrated
        in combination with Visual Studio's Test Impact Analysis to efficiently re-run just
        those tests which were impacted by refactoring.

        Module 9: AGILE DATABASE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
    <p>
        This module lets the SQL Server database developers in on a little secret; they
        can be agile too. By using the database projects in Visual Studio 2012, the database
        developers can join the rest of the team. The students will see how to apply Agile
        database techniques within Visual Studio to support the SQL Server 2005/2008/2008R2
        development lifecycle.</p>

    <h3>
        Module 10: SHIP IT</h3>
    <p>
        Teams need to know that just because they like the functionality doesn't mean the
        Product Owner will. This module revisits acceptance criteria as it pertains to acceptance
        testing. By refining acceptance criteria into manual test steps, team members can
        execute the tests, recording the results and reporting bugs in a number of ways.
        Manual tests will be defined and executed using the Microsoft Test Manager tool.
        As the Sprint completes and an increment of functionality is delivered, the team
        will also learn why and when they should create a branch of the codeline.

    <h3>
        Module 11: OVERCOMING DYSFUNCTION</h3>
    <p>
        This module introduces the many types of people, process, and tool dysfunctions
        that teams face in the real world. Many dysfunctions and scenarios will be identified,
        along with ideas and discussion for how a team might mitigate them. This module
        will enable you and your team to move toward independence and improve your game
        of Scrum when you depart class.

    <p>
        This is a unique course in that it's technically-focused, team-based, and employs
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing">timeboxes</a>. It demands that
        the members of the teams self-organize and self-manage their own work to collaboratively
        develop increments of software.<br />
        All attendees must commit to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pay attention to all lectures and demonstrations</li>
        <li>Participate in team and group discussions</li>
        <li>Work collaboratively with other team members</li>
        <li>Obey the timebox for each activity</li>
        <li>Commit to work and do your best to deliver</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All teams should have these skills:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding of Scrum</li>
        <li>Familiarity with Visual Studio</li>
        <li>C#, .NET 4.0 &amp; ASP.NET 4.0 experience*</li>
        <li>SQL Server 2008 development experience</li>
        <li>Software testing experience </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        * Check with the instructor ahead of time for the exact technologies
    </p>
    <h2>Self-organizing teams</h2>
    <p>
        Another unique attribute of this course is that it's a technical training class
        being delivered to <em>teams</em> of developers, not pairs, and not individuals.
        Ideally, your actual software development team will attend the training to ensure
        that all necessary skills are covered. However, if you wish to attend an open enrolment
        course alone or with just a couple of colleagues, realize that you may be placed
        on a team with other attendees. The instructor will do his or her best to ensure
        that each team is cross-functional to tackle the case study, but there are no guarantees.
        You may be required to try a new role, learn a new skill, or pair with somebody
        unfamiliar to you. This is just good Scrum!
    </p>
    <h2>Who should NOT take this course?</h2>
    <p>
        Because of the nature of this course, as explained above, certain types of people
        should probably <strong>not</strong> attend this course:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Students requiring command and control style instruction - there are no prescriptive/step-by-step
            (think traditional Microsoft Learning) labs in this course</li>
        <li>Students who are unwilling to work within a timebox</li>
        <li>Students who are unwilling to work collaboratively on a team</li>
        <li>Students who don't have any skill in any of the software development disciplines</li>
        <li>Students who are unable to commit fully to their team - not only will this diminish
            the student's learning experience, but it will also impact their team's learning
            experience</li>
    </ul>
