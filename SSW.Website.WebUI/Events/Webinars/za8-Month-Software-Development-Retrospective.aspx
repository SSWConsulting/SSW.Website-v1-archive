		<p>This is probably the most confronting interview we have done at SSW TV!</p> 

        <p>SSW has just spent 8 months building the first release of a transport management system for a major Australian transport company. 
        Join the Product Owner (client) and the lead developer as they hold a live retrospective reflecting on what went well and what could be improved.</p>

        <p>The project was a time and materials engagement using scrum. This warts and all interview is your opportunity to get a behind the scenes look at 
        the scrum process from the perspectives of a client and a developer. You will hear honest feedback of the pros and cons of scrum from both parties.</p>
    
        <p>The webinar will be hosted by Keith Longworth and SSW's own Marlon Marescia and Gerard Beckleg.</p> 

        <p>During the interview each party will be asked:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>How did the client choose the development company and what were the pros and cons of this approach</li>
        <li>How accurate were the estimates compared to the actuals</li>
        <li>What is your philosophy regarding estimates</li>
        <li>What were the shortcomings of scrum</li>
        <li>What were the benefits of scrum</li>
        <li>Did the project finish on time and on budget? How does the business feel about the result?</li>
        <li>If you had to start the project again, what would you change about the project?</li>
        </ol>
