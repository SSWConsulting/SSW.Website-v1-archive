    <p>
        Mobile computing has been a promise for ages. PDAs are a really convenient device
        for many business uses. This session shows how .NET developers can use VS.NET and
        the .NET Compact Framework to create real world applications. This demo will be
        using SQL Server on a handheld device. Along the way Adam will highlight some of
        the features and technologies that you need to be especially careful with and show
        how you can overcome their limitations.

  <a name="IntroductionADONET" id="IntroductionADONET"></a>ADO.NET - Introduction to ADO.NET </del></h1>
    <p>
        ADO.NET is a significant upgrade from ADO, and it changes the techniques for working
        with data. Whether the data is from SQL Server 2008, a Jet MDB file, an XML file,
        or almost any other data source, ADO.NET provides the tools for working with your
        data. This session introduces the basics of ADO.NET, and demonstrates how to retrieve
        and update data.

  <h1><del>
      <a name="HardcoreADONET" id="HardcoreADONET"></a>ADO.NET Going Hardcore with SQL Server 2008</del></h1>
    <p>
        This session focuses on one of the hottest new areas in data access development.
        Learn how you can harness Visual Studio's deep XML support with ADO .NET to
        integrate interoperable, robust data access into your applications and components.
        The .NET framework includes many new classes for data access that require a fundamentally
        different way of using data than in ADO classic. This includes relational data,
        XML data, and other data stores, collectively making up the new ADO.NET. It is designed
        to simplify data access, reduce network traffic, and support distributed, disconnected
        applications. You'll find out how to code the ADO .NET to access the data in SQL
        Server 2008 and the use of strongly typed datasets using XSD and SQL Server 2008
        stored procedures.

        </del></h1>
   
    <p>
        This session will highlight and detail how and where XML can be
            utilized within data tiers. We will discuss the advantages of XML over DCOM and
            MTS/COM+. You&#8217;ll also be given a snapshot profile on how to: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Build stateless objects with XML via ADO</li>
        <li>Design COM objects to use XML efficiently</li>
        <li>Develop an N-tier solution that can use the Internet as its
            network </li>
        <li>Build highly scalable distributed applications</li>
        <li>Use Data Islands for &quot;rich&quot; browser development

        </del></h1>
   
    <p>
        XML brings power, flexibility and interoperability to Web-based
            applications and provides developers and users with an industry standard for expressing
            structured data. XML, a standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
            is viewed as the cornerstone technology for building e-business applications. This
            session looks at how developers can use XML in their applications. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Where you will be using XML</li>
        <li>Assigning attributes</li>
        <li>Defining tags</li>
        <li>Entity references</li>
        <li>Processing instructions</li>
        <li>Validation/document type definitions </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Then you'll advance into:

    <p>
        ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) is Microsoft's strategic, high-level
            interface for all kinds of data. ADO provides the fastest, easiest and most productive
            means for accessing both relational and non-relational data. You'll review the ADO
            object model, and the role of the Connection, Command, Recordset, and Parameters
            objects. Learn how to use ADO to build database solutions in Access, Visual Basic,
            and Office.
