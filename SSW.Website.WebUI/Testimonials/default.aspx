                    I think what the team has done has been great. They've been very responsive and receptive to feedback. The platform they've generated exceeds what I'd first envisioned (i.e., is much higher quality), and of course the fact that we're well below the original cost estimate is also awesome.<br />
                    In summary, I think <a href="https://www.ssw.com.au/people/chris-clement">Chris</a>, <a href="https://www.ssw.com.au/people/alex-rothwell">Alex</a>, <a href="https://www.ssw.com.au/people/joseph-fernandez">Joseph</a>, and <a href="https://www.ssw.com.au/people/sam-smith">yourself</a> have done an amazing job, and I'm looking forward to the internal testing and getting the wider teams feedback.

                    We've commenced the production release of the new Auction Platform which each of you have played a role in developing.<br /><br />
                    While it's still in the early stages of release, so far it has been a great success. Our plan is to continue to monitor, enhance and increase its use over the coming 'busy' months, as we eventually look to phase out the existing system.<br /><br />
                    It has been a massive year of development and learning for all involved, and by all accounts, this is an application that will help set AuctionsPlus up for continued success, growth and service for years to come.<br /><br />
                    On behalf of @Angus and myself, we'd like to say congratulations and thanks for your efforts.

                    As we are now 20 plus weeks into our projects with yourselves I wanted to express that I am very happy with the team's productivity and everyone's participation but especially impressed with <a href="https://www.ssw.com.au/people/jean-thirion">Jean</a>, <a href="https://www.ssw.com.au/people/kosta-madorsky">Kosta</a> and <a href="https://www.ssw.com.au/people/matt-wicks">Matt Wicks</a>.<br /><br />
                    Jean's management is very much on point, prompt, detailed, decisive change management, and outcome focused which is a lot of comfort to me as my time investment capability is minimal but appropriate for the project successful delivery.<br /><br />
                    The interaction and engagement across our organisations is also working well, efficient, collaborative and all things good that I want in a well-run and successful development project.<br /><br />
                    Complements aside, as I have discussed with Jean, I am looking forward to continuing our engagement with this team on 3 follow-on projects already approved and a fourth likely to be approved before Jan 2021, thanks!

Kiki's work has been outstanding and he helped me through a couple of difficult conversations with the client that could have jeopardised the whole progress of not only the implementation of Zendesk but my whole project. Everything is now on track for success thanks to Kiki's work and more particularly his ability to handle an unexpected and tense situation with calm authority.

                    Wouldn't it be useful if you could run an upsizing report before starting the entire process? Well, you can. SSW provides a wonderful tool that can be used before you upsize the database.

                    Dear <a href="https://www.ssw.com.au/people/adam-cogan">Adam Cogan</a>,<br><br>Thank you for the work you've done over the last year to improve our products and help customers be successful. For those of you who were able to join me at the MVP Dinner earlier this month, I enjoyed meeting you face-to-face and very much appreciated hearing your stories. Hosting events like this one is one of my favorite parts of my role here at Microsoft.<br>With over 1,500 developer MVp's and fewer than 40 being recognized as an MVP of the year, you are truly one of our elite partners. Without you, we could not be as successful as we are today. To recognize the part you play, please find a token of our appreciation for all the work you do on Microsoft's behalf.

                    Peter, Your great teaching skills, the very interactive session by showing the "correct" way of doing things (including the various alternative methods) made this class outstanding.
