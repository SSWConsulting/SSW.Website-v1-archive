                <h2>
                    TeamCompanion for TFS 2010</h2>
                <p>
                    Adam Cogan, CEO at SSW says it all:</p>
                <div class="greyBox">
                <p>
                    We are very happy we found this tool from Ekobit. In fact, if we did not have TeamCompanion for Outlook, 
                    we could not use TFS work items. It is the best add-in for TFS, let alone the best TFS add-in for 
                    Microsoft Outlook&trade;. It is the perfect solution, as it solves many problems, starting with the missing 
                    HTML feature (that even TFS 2010 did not solve). It beautifully integrates e-mail and Outlook with Team Foundation 
                    Server and that makes TeamCompanion the single best thing you can do to improve your project communication with 
                    developers and clients.</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In addition TeamCompanion makes working with the TFS data easier. You access project related information using 
                    Outlook without having to switch between applications. It makes it easy to access your most important artifacts 
                    in your Team System environment, such as work items and reports, and you may find you rarely end up using Visual 
                    Studio Team Explorer or Team System Web Access.</p>
                <p>
                    By integrating standard Outlook actions, TeamCompanion increases your productivity dramatically. E-mails make 
                    work items or can be attached to existing work items, and when completed you can send a 'done' email back to the 
                    client. </p>

                    <dd>
                        Figure: TeamCompanion is the #1 tool for TFS, because it makes it easy to work with Team Foundation Server 
                        Work Items within Outlook.

                    TeamLook from Personify Design for TFS 2010</h2>
                <p>
                    Personify Design's TeamLook&trade; also extends Microsoft Outlook. It has less features than TeamCompanion 
                    but still helps stakeholders in a software project to 
                    communicate more effectively and gain accurate visibility
                    into project status. TeamLook&trade; connects to Visual Studio Team Foundation Server
                    and enables users to view WorkItems and Reports.</p>

                <p>
                    Outlook 2007 TFS Addin is a simple tool that provides the ability to work with TFS within Outlook.</p>
                <p>
                    The best advantage of this tool is that it is free and lightweight. However this is also part of the disadvantage as it does not have a complete feature set.<br />
                    <span style="color:red;">Warning:</span> There is no support for TFS 2010. This was developed by a sole developer (Leon Langleyben) and he is no longer active on the project.
