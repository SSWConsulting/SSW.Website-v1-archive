			<h2>FrontPage 2002 </h2>
		</li>
			<p>
				(Yes, number 1 and 2 and not 3rd Party utilities but so many developers use text 
				editors I wanted to include them).			</p>
			<p>	
				FrontPage?  Really? FrontPage???  Many people at a first glance think we're nuts to even consider using FrontPage.  
				Like them, we have always hated FrontPage for one reason: it reformats our nicely formatted HTML, and adds a 
				whole heap of additional tags...			</p>	
			<p>	
				For once, Microsoft must have heard its customers, because one of FrontPage 2002's feature is HTML Preservation.  That is,
				FrontPage will not try to automatically change your HTML (see 
				<a href="/ssw/Redirect/Microsoft/MicrosoftAssisHTML.htm" target="_blank">Details</a>).			</p>

				<img border="0" src="Images/frontpage.gif" alt="" width="259" height="88">
			<br>
				<span class="Caption">Figure: Frontpage</span>
		
			<p>
				Equipped with FTP/FP publishing, a graphics editor, the best part about FrontPage is that it tries to open 
				a website rather than merely a webpage.  When you click the Edit with FrontPage icon on your Internet Explorer, 
				FrontPage will try to open the actual file on the website, unlike many other programs which simply opens 
				the copy in the browser cache.  This sole feature makes it the best tool for quick editing your website.			</p>

			<p class="expiredinfo">
				Whether you are new to Web design or a professional designer, Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 
				is a good choice. Dreamweaver offers a simple, easy-to-use interface with a powerful set 
				of tools and features to help faculty and students create engaging Web sites. Dreamweaver 
				4 delivers productivity enhancements for high-end developers and lowers the barrier to entry for novices.			</p>
			<p class="expiredinfo">
				Dreamweaver also allows you to directly edit the HTML code.The standard code browser has been integrated 
				into the document window, so that code can be reviewed as page elements are added. This feature serves both 
				to familiarise new users with HTML code and to speed up coding considerably. However, we recommend it as a designer for XSL only.</p>

				I am hoping to one day replace this tool with Commerce Server 2006... I dont know much but I believe it will have cool Content Replication included in CS2006. Meaning it will replace the orphaned functionalities of Application Center 2000.
		
				<p>
					It will be interesting to see what they come up with, but I am sure they are aiming for a strong solution to help the staging process of a commercial web site. I expect we will see content replication and also a number of other admin tools to enable site testing and staging.				</p>
				<p>
					So although I am most interested in CS2006 content replication features, most others will like:<br>

						<li>How they extend the personalization and membership of ASP.NET 2.0 to support their existing marketing system</li>
						<li>Other components such as a catalog, datawarehouse, staging, B2B and admin system.</li>

			  <p>Some of the best features:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li>It's FAST (e.g. To compare the SSW standards directory including subfolders with Beyond Compare was 55s, but it took more than twice as long - 2m:15s with FTP Sync)</li>
		        <li>The setting of local timestamps to the same as the server, just like FTPSync</li>
		        <li>You can merge and compare changes between files (unlike FTPSync) </li>
		        <li>It can export/import settings so that other people in your company can have the same settings (unlike FTPSync)</li>
		        <li>It has built	in	file comparison tool (unlike FTPSync) and can launch file viewers directly from the interface (unlike FTPSync) </li>
		      <li>The one tool can be used for both your file synchronization and FTP synchronization needs (you need FileSync and FTPSync for this) </li>
		      <li>It supports Several plug-ins including a picture comparison plugin for comparing images (unlike FTPSync) </li>
		      <li>It supports scripting  for automated operations (unlike FTPSync) </li>
			<li>Can ignore minor differences like whitespace (unlike FTPSync) </li>
			<li>It uses an explorer-like interface </li>
			<li>It has more options for file comparison  and filtering rules than you can shake a stick at including CRC checks  </li>
			<li>It has drop-down file name auto-completion like IE/Windows Explorer </li>
			<li>Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V actually works in the path fields (unlike FTPSync)</li>
		    <li>It shows if the contents of subdirectories are different - with colour coding of folders</li>
		    <li>Previously selected synch folder combinations will be automatically selected when you choose a folder to synchronize</li>

				Deliver Access Reports online with Access Reporter .NET for IIS.			</p>
			<p>
				SSW Access Reporter .NET for IIS is designed to keep Access open and available. 
				The idea is, that only one Microsoft Access object needs to be open, saving on resource 
				consumption. Also, as the Access object is kept open, the server is ready to process requests 
				for reports quickly, as there is no need for the overhead of starting Access each time a report 
				needs to be run. ADPs are snazzy as you get the functionality of great looking reports with a SQL backend.			</p>
			<p>
				The Report Server provides the user with Several reporting formats, including Rich Text 
				Format (RTF), Text only, Microsoft Excel format (XLS), HTML, Microsoft Access Snapshot format 
				(SNP), and Adobe Acrobat format (PDF).			</p>

			<h2>File Sync</h2>
			<p>
				FileSync is our file/folder synchronisation utility and is the most complete solution for 
				keeping files up to date between your notebook and desktop or workstation and server. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By simply specifying source and target folder paths and the file types that you require, 
				FileSync will produce a comparison list of the relevant files showing which need to be copied 
				and in which direction. You then have the option to filter the list, examine specific files 
				for differences and change copy directions before going ahead with the synchronisation process.
			</p>
			<p>
				The binary comparison capability is ideal for checking the integrity of CD-R and CD-RW recordings.
