		<p>Instant Messenger made its way into SSW by stealthy means. While I was initially suspicious of its impact on our organization, Messenger grew on me as I became aware of its usefulness. It's perfect for interoffice communication, for quick questions, requests for assistance and notification of phone calls. However, it is not good for any task based  requests such as &quot;Please complete the monthly sales reports.&quot;</p>
		<p>Using Messenger solely for business use means it's become an invaluable tool for running our organization.</p>
		<p>Do you agree with them all? Are we missing some? Email me your tips, thoughts or arguments.&nbsp; <a href="/ssw/Employees/EmployeesProfile.aspx?EmpID=CS"> Let me know</a> what you think.</p>

				<h2><a name="ImportantChatsEmail"></a>Do you know important chats should be in an email?</h2>
			        <p>First of all, understand that IM is distracting so use it judiciously. However IM is great when an email is unclear or you have an additional question about the email that is stopping you from sending a 'done'. IM is great for reminding people and is excellent to push the important things... especially for people who ignore emails!</p>
			        <p>During the course of an IM chat with a client or manager, an action or a piece of work may be required. It's highly important that such chats are copied from the chat and pasted into an email.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <div class="greyBox">
                        <p>"As per our IM conversation, I will XXX."</p>
                    </div>
                <p>When you copy and paste a skype conversation into an email remember the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Who are you sending the email too? Is there any private information that should not be shared with the group?</li>
                    <li>Have you asked for permission to copy the skype conversation into an email? The other party may not want to share it in an email</li>
                    <li>Does the conversation add value to the email or can it be left out?</li>
                    <li>If you decide to copy the conversation then make sure you edit it so it is easy to read and relevant</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Make it readable by snipping out just the important information and CC relevant parties. (See <a href="#ConfirmChats">rule on Snipping</a> for more information).</p>
            </li>

		    <li>
                <h2><a name="ConfirmChats"></a>Do you make the email readable by snipping and formatting the IM chat?</h2>
                <p>Once you have decided to put an IM chat into an email or manager may suggest a course of action or a piece of work that they would like completed. It's highly important that such chats are copied from the chat screen, pasted into an email, and sent to the client or manager with a note: "Confirming our IM chat this morning", and CC'ing anyone else who is relevant. Don't just paste the whole conversation into an email.</p>
                <p>Snip the relevant information only. You can do this by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deleting junk that is not related to the conversation</li>
                    <li>Deleting repetitive junk that makes it hard to read (like peoples names)</li>
                    <li>Adding a line break between people and highlighting the person's name in <strong>BOLD</strong></li>
                </ul>

                </dl>
                <p>Having an email record is much better than going through chat logs when it comes to going through a project debrief. Having it nice an readable is even better.</p>           
            </li>

            <li>
               <h2><a name="IMInterrupt"></a>Do you know that IM interrupts? If you don't need it now, email it.</h2>
                   <p>When somebody sends you an email, they are not in fact interrupting you at all. You have made the decision to read your emails, so email is in actual fact far more polite than IM which is a complete nuisance.</p>
                   <p>IM is only to be used if they would like you to do something NOW.</p>           
            </li>
		
			<li>
				<h2><a name="CompanyName"></a>Do you use your company name as part of your display name?</h2>
			
			        <dl class="image">
                        <dt><img src="Images/IMOptionsName.gif" alt="IM Options Name" border="1" width="382" height="84" /></dt>
			            <dd>Figure: Display your company name</dd>
                    </dl>
		            <p>Using your company name as part of your Display Name has the double advantage or firstly branding, and secondly, indicating to other parties that your IM account is for work purposes.</p>
			        <p>
			        And be aware that MSN Messenger doesn't allow you to rename the 
                    account... So use your full name. I say this because if you just 
                    use &quot;Peter&quot;, then I can't distinguish you from the 3 other Peters I 
                    have. If you are unable to change your display name, validate your email.
			        </p>
			        <p>
			        Note: One of the common questions is &quot;Where are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                    You can avoid this by putting the square brackets where you currently are 
                    eg. [SSW] or [Cisco  Melbourne]</p>
                    <p>
                    The other common question is &quot;What are you doing?&quot; 
                    </p>
                    <p>You can 
			        also avoid this by putting the product name you are currently 
			        working on eg. "SSW Exchange Reporter" in the personal message section of your 
			        MSN name. This can be easily changed, without having to go into your options, 
			        at the top of the MSN display.</p>

                <h2><a name="GoodNewsPersonalMessage"></a>Do you use your personal message to share good news with your contacts?</h2>
                    <p>Your personal message can be used to promote good news stories of recent work you have done.</p>
                    <p>If you have your <a href="RulesToBeingSoftwareConsultantsDealingWithClients.aspx#ClientsUsingMessenger">clients added as Instant Messenger contacts</a>, what better group of people to share good news with.</p>

				<h2><a name="MinimiseMSNMessengerDistractions"></a>Do you minimize MSN Messenger distractions?</h2>
                    <p><a href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DealWithDistractions.aspx">Dealing with distractions</a> is a fundamental rule to a successful project. MSN Messenger is a great way to get distracted. Following these options helps you to minimize Messenger distractions:</p> 
				    <ul>
				    <li>Set your status to Busy - people will think twice before messaging you</li>
				    <li>Don't display an alert when a contact comes online</li>
				    <li>Don't play a sound when you receive an email. Remember - you do need a sound when you receive an IM in case you're not looking at your PC when it arrives...</li>
				</ul>
                <dl class="image">
                    <dt><img src="Images/IMAlerts.gif" alt="IM Alerts" border="1" width="373" height="134" /></dt>
                    <dd>Figure: minimize the Alerts you receive</dd>
                </dl>	
			    <p>If you run Outlook to manage email you should also <a href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/MinimiseOutlookDistractions.aspx"> minimize Outlook distactions</a></p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h2><a name="OfflineContacts"></a>Do you put Offline contacts in a separate category?</h2>
			        <p>If a contact is not signed in, you don't need to see them. Otherwise, they become a distraction.</p>
                        <dl class="image">
                            <dt><img src="Images/IMSortContactsOnlineOffline.gif" alt="IM Sort Contacts Online Offline"/></dt>
                            <dd>Figure: Show Offline contacts in a separate category</dd>
                        </dl>
		    </li>	
            	
		    <li>
			    <h2><a name="SendUnnecessaryMessages"></a>Do you send avoid sending unnecessary messages?</h2>
			        <p>Sending an unnecessary Instant Message is a distraction to the person you sent it to. Follow the <a href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/SendUnnecessaryEmails.aspx">5 word rule</a>; if your message is less than 5 words, e.g. "Great work!" or "Thanks!", it's probably not required.</p>
			        <p>Exceptions to this rule, of course, are when acknowledgement of the IM is required. We use IM in the office to notify that "John from F1 is on line 1." If the respondent doesn't say "OK" promptly we have to get up and go find them so John isn't left hanging on the line...</p>

				<h2><a name="messengerinterrupts"></a>Do you know that IM interrupts? If you don't need it now, email it.</h2>
				    <p>When somebody sends you an email, they are not in fact interrupting you at all. You have made the decision to read your emails, so email is in actual fact far more polite than IM which is a complete nuisance.</p>
				    <p>IM is only to be used if they would like you to do something NOW.</p>
		    </li>

		    <li>
				<h2><a name="KeepIMHistory"></a>Do you keep history of your IM conversations?</h2>
                    <p>IM conversations often can be as if not more important than emails, because they are usually only 
					used for high priority issues or issues that need to be resolved now. Therefore it is very 
					important to keep history of all your IM conversations. They can often be used as a reference 
					point, or as a digital log of all the important issues that have been discussed. In fact, you 
					can be guaranteed that you will want to revisit something you have discussed before with 
					other employees.</p>		
			        <p>The only exception to this rule of course is when you're using a public computer, in which case privacy and security issues arise by keeping IM history on that computer.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
				<h2><a name="Research"></a>Do you investigate your question for two minutes before asking someone on IM?</h2>
			        <p>Always do a quick investigation before asking for help. When asking a question using IM, always start your conversation with "I have googled this and no luck".</p>
					<p>IM can interrupt a person when they are busy, so make sure that you are well prepared and have tried to find the solution another way first.</p>		
            </li>
            
           <li>
				<h2><a name="Confirmation"></a>Do you send a confirmation message in IM to someone before you try calling them?</h2>
                    <p>Always try to ping someone on IM first with "can I call you now?" , because they might be with a client, or in a session.</p>		
          </li>

          <li>
                <h2><a name="DisplayPicture"></a>Do you set your display picture using a good photographic image of yourself?</h2>
                    <p>In person conversations are much better than chats over the phone. Skype or Lync calls with video cams are great, but you wont do that all the time for bandwidth and processing power reasons. The next best thing is to have a great professional picture of yourself. Avoid using a built-in image.</p>

                    <p>Using instant messengering applications is all about communication. If something is urgent and you are not answering IMs, it is likely the next thing the person will do is to start looking for your phone number. Make it easy for them by adding your phone number to your IM description.</p>

                <p>Communication using voice is much faster than typing a message and it can clear misunderstandings. Encourage people to switch to voice if possible.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <div class="greyBox">
                    <p><strong>- Adam Cogan:</strong> Did you say to me, you would contact Tiago on Skype to do it collaboratively... rather than email?<br />
                    <strong>- Danijel Malik:</strong> I agreed I'll contact them over Skype as suggested by Drew<br />
                    <strong>- Adam Cogan:</strong> Isn't that what I just said? (and you said you were sending emails)<br />
                    <strong>- Danijel Malik:</strong> Hold on...I don't understand you anymore, <span style="background-color:Yellow;">can we switch to voice?</span></p>
