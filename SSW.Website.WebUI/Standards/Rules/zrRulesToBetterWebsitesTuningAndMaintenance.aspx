    <p>You would not buy an expensive car without undergoing regular 
	maintenance. The same logic applies to websites; websites are in need of 
	constant fine tuning and maintenance to ensure they are presenting suitable 
	content to the user, performing well and reflecting your organization&#8217;s 
	goals.</p>
        <p>Do you agree with them all? Are we missing some? <a href="javascript:sendEmail('6D61696C746F3A496E666F407373772E636F6D2E61753F5375626A6563743D52756C6573253230746F253230426574746572253230576562736974657325323054756E696E67253230416E642532304D61696E74656E616E6365')">

    <p>What brings customers back to your website time and time again? &#8211; It&#8217;s 
	fresh content. We will help you keep your website up to date, whether it&#8217;s 
	by implementing a content management system or updating pages for you, which 
	will drive customer interest.</p>
	<p>Perhaps the quickest and easiest way to post 
	fresh content to your existing site is to implement a blog. These are a few that 
	we can recommend to use:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/SSW/Redirect/Communityserver.htm" class="external">Community Server</a><br />
		A very powerful blog engine based on .NET technology. You can host it 
		alongside your existing website or choose a hosted plan</li>
		<li><a href="/SSW/Redirect/Wordpress.htm" class="external">WordPress</a><br />
		The favorite among bloggers. WordPress is based on PHP/MySQL combination 
		which is available on most hosting environment. It supports multiple 
		categories and password-protected content. <br />
		</li>
		<li><a href="/SSW/Redirect/Blogger.htm" class="ex">Blogger</a><br />
		Blogger is perhaps one of the simplest blogging service out there. It's owned 
		by Google, so you can sign in using your Gmail account and start blogging 
		right away. Nice features worth mentioning include full access to 
		create/modify your blog template, great multi-user capability and the 
		option to upload your blog to your own FTP server.<br />
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
    <li><h2><a name="NewImages"></a>Do you continually improve the user 
	interface?</h2>
    <p>As the web development industry matures, best practices of website 
	usability are continually improving. You should regularly update your 
	website's user interface to reflect these changes. Good examples are 
	breadcrumbs (seen at the top of this page) and cascading menus. Not only are 
	these features an easy way to find what you want and know where you 
	currently are in a website hierarchy, there are also standards that users 
	are becoming familiar with.<br />

    <p>SSW has talented designers who can improve the aesthetics and usability 
	by tweaking images, design and navigation of your website.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
	<h2><a name="GoogleKeywords"></a>Do you monitor your Google keywords?</h2>
	<p>Making sure that your site content to include specific keywords is just 
	one part of the story. You need to constantly monitor how they perform. Here 
	are a couple of ways you can achieve this:</p>
	<p><strong>Method 1: Use a SEO software</strong><br />
	We found that <a href="/SSW/Redirect/Webceo.htm" class="external">WebCEO</a> provides a 
	comprehensive&nbsp;features for managing and maintaining our keywords</p>
	<dl class="image">
	<dt><img alt="Screenshot of WebCEO showing keyword rankings for SSW" src="Images/webceo.jpg" width="512" height="385" /></dt>
	<dd>Figure: Using an SEO software such as WebCEO allows you to quickly see how your keywords are performing</dd></dl>
	
	<p>Another method is to keep a file e.g. keyword.aspx which includes </p>
	<p>We recommend that you do this as well as implementing some more from 	<a href="/SSW/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterGoogleRankings.aspx">Rules to 
	Better Google Rankings</a></p>
	</li>
    <li><h2><a name="CompetitiveAnalysis"></a>Do you perform competitive 
	analysis?</h2>
    <p>SSW will have several team members independently research your 
	competitors&#8217; website, products and services to provide an unbiased 
	comparative report on:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Website usability</li>
    <li>Ease of understanding business focus</li>
    <li>Effectiveness of product sales message</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>
	<h2><a name="GoogleCache"></a>Do you monitor Google's cache?</h2>
	<p>
	    You need to make sure that all your pages are in the google cache as per <a href="/ssw/LinkAuditor/UserGuide.aspx#RSReport_PageRank">SSW Link Auditor Google PageRank Report</a>
	</p>
	</li>
    <li><h2><a name="WebsiteStatistics"></a>Do you analyze your website 
	statistics (e.g. Google Analytics)?</h2>
    <p>There is a lot of information tucked away in your web server log files. 
	Valuable, but often unused, information that can be retrieved from your web 
	server log files include:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Geographical origin of users</li>
    <li>Referring pages (which external pages did the users come from e.g. 
	search engines)</li>
    <li>Number of users</li>
    <li>Time spent on the website</li>
    <li>Reasons for user&#8217;s early departure</li>
    <li>Popularity of pages within your website</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <a href="../templates/sswgooglereporttemplate.aspx">A sample template of Google Analytics report</a>
    </p>
    
    </li>
    <li><h2><a name="SecuritySystemCheck"></a>Do you perform security and system 
	checks?</h2>
    <p>To maintain the stability of your server and help protect against harmful 
	attacks, your server should only be running necessary services, and all 
	software should have the latest updates.</p>
    <p>This includes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Check that your operating system has the latest patches</li>
    <li>Check the system for software updates using SSW Diagnostics</li>
    <li>Check system event logs for software error reports</li>
    <li>Check the system is only running necessary services</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><h2><a name="WebsitePerformance"></a>Do you analyze your website's 
	performance?</h2>
    <p>For a smooth and responsive user experience, your site needs to be 
	checked for performance bottlenecks. These usually become noticeable 
	sometime after deployment, as your user base and quantity of content grows.</p>
    <p>This includes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Check for and improve the slowest pages</li>
    <li>Check for and improve the compression of unnecessarily large images</li>
    <li>Check for and improve inefficient Ajax JavaScript code</li>
    <li>Check for and improve the slowest database queries</li>
    <li>Suggest appropriate use of Ajax to improve page responsiveness</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><h2><a name="MainBrowsers"></a>Do you test on main browsers?</h2>
      <p>There are many browsers available, and each one renders HTML, CSS and Scripts differently. Making web pages look perfect in all of them is time consuming and expensive. You should provide support only to the main browsers, unless specifically requested by the client.</p>
      <p>Your site should support (be tested):</p>
      <ul>  
        <li>Internet Explorer 7 and later</li>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your site should be readable on:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Google Chrome</li>
       <li>Safari</li>
       <li>Opera</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h2><a name="UserSatisfaction"></a>Do you perform user satisfaction 
	studies?</h2>
    <p>As part of an overall usability assessment, you should ask users about 
	their experience. SSW will prepare a balanced questionnaire for your user 
	base and contact selected customers for you. The objective is to find 
	weaknesses within the site that can be improved.</p>
	</li>
    <li><h2><a name="ChangingGoals"></a>Do you respond to changing goals?</h2>
    <p>Websites are designed to communicate what the company is about as well as 
	the services and products which the company provides.</p></li>
	<li><h2><a name="UptimeReport"></a>Do you have uptime report for your website?</h2>
	<p>Website should have uptime report to provide real-time and historical performance and availability information. </p>

    <dl class="image">
    <dt><img src="Images/ServerUptimeReport_skype.GIF"></dt>
    <dd>Figure: Uptime report - no history information</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>With history information, you can get exact downtime of your website or services in the past.  </p>
    <dl class="image">
    <dt><img src="Images/ServerUptimeReport_salesforce.GIF"></dt>
    <dd>Figure: Uptime report - with history information</dd>
    </dl>

	</li>
	<li><h2><a name="HealthCheck"></a>Do you have a HealthCheck page (from /zsValidate) to make sure your website is healthy?</h2>
	<p>
	    Websites can be complicated, and a very small mistake can take the whole site down. But there are two different kind of errors, coding errors and deployment errors; 
	    coding errors should be picked up by compiling and debugging, while deployment errors should be picked up by HealthCheck page.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Whenever there is a deployment problem, instead of fixing it straight away, we find out what the cause of the problem is  
	    and create a HealthCheck test to prevent it happening again. So next time, when the site is down or re-deployed to a new server, 
	    we can simply run the HealthCheck page and fix all red crosses then the site should be back online.

            <li>Run <a href="/ssw/Redirect/treesize.htm">Treesize</a> to determine which folders can be excluded. For example, "Download?isn't included in web solution, 
            so this folder can be excluded. The reason why we use <a href="/ssw/Redirect/treesize.htm">Treesize</a> is because it will tell you which folder is the biggest

   <li><h2><a name="TroubleShoot"></a>Do you know the standard procedure to troubleshoot if a website is down?</h2>
    <p>When a site is down, you have to troubleshoot the problem. During troubleshooting, you might need to restart the IIS services. Here're several steps you can follow. </p>
    <ol>
    <li><a href="/ssw/Redirect/Microsoft/RestartWebSite.htm" target="_blank" class="external" >Restart the website</a>.</li>
    <li>If step 1 doesn't work, try to <a href="/ssw/Redirect/Microsoft/RecycleAppPool.htm" class="external" target="_blank" >recycle the application pool</a> of the site. </li>
    <li>If step 2 doesn't work, try to restart IIS.</li>
    <li>If step 3 doesn't work either, then reboot the web server machine (step 3 or step 4 is a severe action. You <strong>should get the approval</strong> of network administrators or ask them to do this).</li>
    <li>If the site is still not working, turn on the maintenance page and then try to reproduce the problem on the testing site. <strong>DO NOT</strong> connect your testing site to the production database. If you need the production database, make a copy of it and restore it to your testing machine.</li>
       </ol> 
    <p>Still not fixed? Escalate the issue. Please refer to <a href="/ssw/standardsinternal/inductiontraining/InductionDay3.aspx#Website">SSW Website Maintenance Procedure.</a></p>
   </li>
   <li><h2><a name="MaintenancePages"></a>
   Does every project have auto-generated maintenance pages?</h2>
       <p>Nowadays, most application are dealing with Data. And it would be nice to have maintenance pages to manage data (select, insert, update and delete).</p>
       <p>We recommend you create the maintenance pages by netTiers. <a href="/ssw/Standards/Developergeneral/netTools.aspx#NetTiers">netTiers</a> is a set of open source code templates used in CodeSmith for object-relational mapping. It automatically generates a personalized Data Tiers application (on a base of a SQL Server Database) in just a few minutes. With the application it generated, you can manage data of a web application easily and efficiently.</p>
       <p>Please follow these steps to create your maintenance pages.</p>
       <ol>
           <li><a href="/ssw/redirect/CodeSmith.htm" class="external">Download</a> CodeSmith.</li>
           <li><a href="/ssw/redirect/nettiers.htm" class="external">Download</a> .netTiers and extract to a folder (e.g., C:\Program Files\Net Tiers)</li>

	        Often times, web pages are dynamic. Most link scanners are not capable of submitting form information. The trick is to allow a 
	        &quot;door&quot; for link scanner go through to scan a dynamic section of a site.  A common technique is to hard coded hidden 
	        link with a query string at the bottom of the page that allows the link scanner to follow in to the simulated user input.  See our
	        <a href="/ssw/KB/KBResult.aspx?searchOn=ProdID&searchFor=VSNET">knowledge base</a> page for example.  You will have to look in the HTML source, and find the following
	        code:
       </p>
       <dl class="goodCode">
           <dt>
               <pre>
&lt;a href='KB.aspx?KBID=Q1097707'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1097707&lt;/strong&gt;-How do I turn Option Strict on by default in VB.NET?&lt;/a&gt;
               </pre>
           </dt>
           <dd>Figure: Example source code - finding broken links</dd>
       </dl>
       <p>
           It will return all the knowledge base articles in a paged format. The link scanner will click the Next Page link and eventually scan
	       through the entire knowledge base.
