        Marketing is inherently not that complex: at the end of the day its about making
        your business attractive to others. But this doesnt mean that your approach to marketing
        should be to blindly dive in head first without any foresight or systematic approach.
        Many companies choose this route, spend lots of money and provide very few results.
        Instead, you should ensure that your marketing activities are focused at your target
        market and sustainable - showing a solid ROI.

                    <a name="Marketingplan"></a>Do you have a Marketing Plan?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you were going to build a house, you would hope that the architect and builders
                    are working together using architectural plans and blue prints as a guide. So why
                    would trying to build a solid customer base or market share be any different?</p>
                <p>
                    At SSW we realize the monumental importance of a marketing plan. Although we recognize
                    that in many cases marketing plans get filed away in the closet, until its time
                    to get a business loan it's most effective when it acts as a blue print for all
                    the marketing activities a company undertakes.</p>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the important points to consider in a marketing plan.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sets out your marketing goals and objectives then aligns them with overall business
                        goals and strategy</li><li>Sets out a time frame for achieving its goals</li><li>Identifies
                            a target market and segmentation strategy</li><li>How you will position and differentiate
                                your product</li><li>Competitors and industry analysis</li><li>Identifies current and
                                    proposed marketing methods</li><li>Includes marketing reports (historical and forecasts)&nbsp;
                                    </li>
                    <li>It sets the criteria which the plan will be assessed for success or failure</li></ul>
                <p>
                    The most important thing to remember about a marketing plan is that it is a work
                    in progress.&nbsp;Always needing to be reassessed and changed to adapt to the dynamic
                    business environment.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    <a name="TargetMarket"></a>Have you identified your target market?</h2>
                <p>
                    It's important to identify the market which will gain you the maximum amount of
                    benefit if captured. It should be the focal point of most of your marketing efforts.
                    The target market needs to be clearly identified with a justification as to why
                    they are your specified target market.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    At SSW our target market comprises of IT Managers and Developers who look for Microsoft
                    backed solutions. They're the ones we focus our marketing energies on because we've
                    found that they're the key decision makers when it comes to adopting new technologies
                    and often act as the gate keepers to information being relayed to upper management.
                    If we gain their approval, it's often much easier to secure a deal. Part of our
                    penetration strategy towards this target market is to hold <a href="/ssw/Events/SSWTechBreakfast.aspx">
                        Tech Breakfasts</a> and <a href="/ssw/Netug/">User Group</a> meetings.<br />
                    <br />
                    To use an example when Disney releases a new blockbuster cartoon like the Lion King
                    or Aladdin who do you think the target market is? Many would say it's the young
                    children that the movies are made for. But the truth is that Disney's target market
                    often includes the decision makers - the parents who take the children to the movies
                    and buy the merchandise. Disney knows that it's one thing to make a great movie
                    that kids are excited about but the efforts often fall short if parents don't approve
                    of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>
                    <a name="CustomizeToTargetMarket"></a>Do you customize your approach to your target
                    market?</h2>
                <p>
                    Every target market is different, and each one will respond to different stimuli
                    that tickle their particular fancy. It is a good idea to customize your marketing
                    approach to consider the particular interests and needs of that group, both in terms
                    of the substance of your pitch, and its style.</p>
                <p>
                    For example, say you are trying to sell your car. It's a nice new Holden, with a
                    V8 under the hood and shiny new mag's. If an elderly person comes to have a look
                    at your car, how do you sell it to them? You need to emphasise the features that
                    will appeal to them.
                    <!-- Instead of telling them about the engine and the mags, 
	talk about the fact that it's done low km's, has numerous airbags for safety and the brake pads are in good condition.
	If you can tailor the content of your sales approach in this way, you greatly increase your chances of closing the deal.-->
                </p>
                At SSW, when a business owner walks in as opposed to a developer, we have to modify
                our pitch. While a business owner would probably be more interested in the general
                goals and how our solution is going to affect his business, a developer is more
                likely to want to know the technical details of the job and how it will be implemented.<p>
                    The same applies to the style in which you put your case forward. Everyone has different
                    taste when it comes to the way that they respond to a marketing pitch. Some people
                    like simplicity so it would be useful to use diagrams, examples, and to make it
                    logically structured. Some people like detail so you should dot the i's and cross
                    the t's. Some people want to make a decision immediately - be prepared to accommodate
                    this. Finally, some people want to think about it - again, be prepared for this
                    scenario.</p>
                <p>
                    Following these simple rules will greatly enhance your chance of marketing success!

                <h2>
                    <a name="SellTheSizzleNotTheSteak"></a>Do you sell the sizzle, not the steak?</h2>
                <p>
                    'Selling the sizzle, not the steak" - the benefits, not the features - is a basic
                    selling principle that's been around for thousands of years. We all know that people
                    buy a 1/4-inch drill so that they can make a 1/4-inch hole. But I'm always amazed
                    at how many businesses, large and small, keep on plugging the features of their
                    product or service, and omit the benefits to the user.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engineers list the technical specs </li>
                    <li>Lawyers list all of the services they offer </li>
                    <li>Software houses plug the bells and whistles of version 6.3 </li>
                    <li>Airlines describe their full destination lists </li>
                    <li>..and so on. Look at any six adverts in a business magazine, and I'll bet that at
                        least three fall into this trap. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A good example of a benefit is shown in this Colgate toothpaste slogan; "Your teeth
                    will be whiter so you can smile with confidence."</p>
                <p>
                    Of course, features do need to be described. That's one way of convincing prospects
                    that you can deliver the benefits that prospective customers want. However, if you
                    concentrate only on the features, the prospect may well yawn and say "So what?"
                    Is your business guilty as charged? Here's 3 ways to check:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look closely at your sales literature - including sales letters that you write.
                        How many times are features described without stating the benefits of that feature?
                    </li>
                    <li>Check your sales peoples' reports (verbal as well as written). How many times do
                        they state what features the prospect wants rather than the real needs of the prospect,
                        the benefits that s/he is looking for? </li>
                    <li>When you are in a sales situation, just listen to yourself. Are you so carried away
                        with the excellent features of your product or service that you are not taking the
                        trouble to find out what the prospect really wants? </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>
                    <a name="Methods"></a>Do you measure the effectiveness of your marketing efforts?</h2>
                <p>
                    Management seem to have a huge focus on facts and figures and much like most other
                    things in the business arena, in marketing you need to be able to put numbers to
                    your results. You'll need to justify why you chose one option over another with
                    a solid figure. Because there are a myriad of ways in which you can market your
                    products/services there's a managerial expectation that you'll be able to reflect
                    on its performance.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    For example if you're coordinating some outbound calling, you need to make sure
                    that all of the calls that are made are logged and you can query for closing rates.
                    See our <a href="/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterOutboundCalls.aspx#Measure">outbound
                        rules</a> for more detail. In addition when you're measuring the effectiveness
                    of your campaigns you need to know what marketing figures are considered a success
                    for your different types of marketing campaigns. For example direct mail campaigns
                    with a conversion rate of 2%-5% is considered a success due to the volume of people
                    we contact.

                <h2>
                    <a name="Brand"></a>Do you have a consistent brand image?</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you have figured out your brand image we think that the most important thing
                    is sticking to it and applying it in every little facet of your business. As you're
                    surfing the SSW website you'll notice a very consistent approach to branding. Our
                    fonts, tables and headings are in exactly the same format and we have applied this
                    to our email signatures, product banners, newsletters and company brochures. <a href="/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterBranding.aspx">

                <h2>
                    <a name="Rotate"></a>Do you rotate your marketing communications?</h2>
                <p>
                    The way that marketing communications strategy is planned and measured is through
                    the concepts of frequency and reach. Frequency being how often the message is broadcast,
                    and reach being how many people receive it. We cover the frequency part of the equation
                    by rotating our product advertising on a monthly basis and increasing our reach
                    by applying this rotation to several different points of contact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example:</p>
                <dl class="image">
                    <dt>
                        <img src="Images/HomeAd2.gif" alt="Home Ad 2" width="500" height="586" /></dt><dd>Figure:
                            In July 2003, we advertised Incident PRO! on our home page</dd></dl>

                            That month we also featured Incident PRO! on all of our staff's email footers</dd></dl>

                <p>
                    At the end of the month we would check the click throughs that these links have
                    generated which will allow us to compare one marketing point of contact against
                    another. Then in the following month we would simply rotate the ad. Here's a scenario
                    that&nbsp;depicts how we envisage our strategy to work.</p>

                                NOTE: If you've got scrolling links like we do on our home page it's a good idea
                                to keep the information up to date. We say that these should be changed on a monthly
                                basis.

                        PRO! ad</li><li>If he has any contact with our employees (mainly via email) he'll once
                            again see an ad in the email footers</li><li>Later on in the month Joe will receive
                                the newsletter with Incident PRO! advertised. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This means that Joe has had a chance to see the same ad at least four times by the
                    end of the month. All this at a total cost of zero dollars!</p>

                <h2>
                    <a name="MarketingTime"></a>Do you plan in advance for your marketing campaigns?</h2>
                <p>
                    In marketing good timing is the key to a successful campaign.&nbsp;As a smart marketer
                    you need to remember that some campaigns can take weeks or even months to start
                    heating up whilst others can take just a few days.</p>
                <p>
                    For example SSW have found that when we plan to market our training events, the
                    best time for an aggressive direct mail and telemarketing campaign is 4 weeks prior
                    to the event. Any sooner than that and the prospects will often ask you to call
                    again when it comes closer to the date. If you start your marketing for your events
                    too late, like 5 days prior to the event, your chances of making a sale decrease
                    significantly. Remember that people often need to gain management approval for the
                    funding and time off work. Only rarely will you find someone willing to book in
                    just a few days prior to the event.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    <a name="EvaluationForms"></a>Do you bring evaluation forms to every event you speak
                    at?</h2>
                <p>
                    The best way to find out how your clients and customers think about you is to ask
                    them. If you're not up to putting your pride on the line by asking them yourself
                    then the next best way is to use surveys or evaluation forms. It's discrete, impartial
                    and gives the evaluator a chance to add comments that may be difficult to say to
                    you in person.</p>
                <p>
                    At SSW we bring our eval forms to every event we run or speak at. This allows us
                    to reflect on our performance and run some quantitative analysis on the survey results.
                    Take a look at our <a href="/ssw/NETUG/UGEvaluationSurvey.aspx">Speakers and Presentation
                        Evaluation Form</a>.</p>

                <h2>
                    <a name="Prospects"></a>Do your evaluation forms identify prospects?</h2>
                <p>
                    An evaluation form can be a great method of collecting information both about your
                    own performance and the needs and wants of your market. You should always have questions
                    in your evaluation forms that will allow you to add elements to your database which
                    can be queried against in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the SSW Speakers and Presentation Evaluation Form we give people the chance to
                    provide some feedback as well as ask some questions which will allow us to identify
                    new prospects and their interests. This information is invaluable and your company
                    database should be Configure to hold and query this information. But remember the golden
                    rule of collecting information is to give people the chance to &quot;opt out&quot;
                    of being contacted in the future. Failing to do this is in breach of&nbsp; privacy
                    laws.&nbsp;On our evaluation forms we have a link to our <a href="/ssw/Company/Privacy.aspx">
                        privacy policy</a>.&nbsp;

                    <a name="Prizes"></a>Do you use door prizes and giveaways at your events?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A golden rule of marketing is:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <i><b>&quot;People love gifts and surprises&quot;</b></i></blockquote>
                <p>
                    Taking this into consideration: a great and effective way to promote your company
                    is to give people free stuff. A very simple yet effective method. Each month at
                    the Sydney .NET User Group, attendees receive SSW show bags filled with free software
                    and company brochures. User group attendees are also encouraged to hand in their
                    eval forms with a lucky dip prize. People love anything that is free so always bring
                    more than enough. Just remember that when you're giving things away make sure you
                    have something genuine to offer them aside from your sales/company brochures.<br />
                    <br />
                    When we were at TechEd in New Orleans our conference booth was right next to <a href="/ssw/Redirect/desaware.htm">
                        Dan Appleman's</a> booth. He had a barrel which spun around like the ones you
                    find on bingo nights, and every day we'd see hundreds of developers line up for
                    half an hour for a chance to win the raffle. I was amazed at the lengths people
                    would go to for a chance to win something so insignificant as a plastic toy.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    So what have I learnt from this experience? Next time we're getting a bigger barrel!</p>

                <h2>
                    <a name="Contact"></a>Do you take advantage of every point of contact?</h2>
                <p>
                    Every point of contact that you have with your customers is a potential to sell
                    them something, whether that be other products or services or even to sell the company
                    as a whole by saying how great we are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some examples of how we take advantage of every point of contact with our
                    target market:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At SSW we send a tech breakfast flyer with the invoices that we send via snail mail</li><li>
                        We give out SSW bags and flyers at our User Group</li><li>Have advertisements at the
                            bottom of our email footers</li><li>All SSW staff wear SSW shirts when meeting with
                                prospects/clients</li><li>When we present at other events our slides are branded with
                                    the SSW logo</li></ul>
                <p>
                    We think that it's the little things like this that may make the difference!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>
                    <a name="Useful"></a>Is your website a useful reference for your target market?</h2>
                <p>
                    We are often taken aback with the cool features and things we can do with HTML and
                    JavaScript allowing us to create websites with snazzy menu bars and visually enticing
                    brochure websites. Whilst those might look cool, we think that the great websites
                    are ones that are useful with valuable content.<br />
                    <br />
                    At SSW we're committed to adding valuable content to our website for our target
                    audience (IT Managers and Developers). Our developers are constantly adding to our
                    <a href="/ssw/KB/">knowledge base</a> answering questions that are emailed to us
                    from developers across the globe. We're also very open about our <a href="/ssw/Standards/Rules/Default.aspx">
                        rules and standards</a> and believe that if you see eye to eye with our standards,
                    you're probably exactly the kind of client we want.

                <h2>
                    <a name="Conventional"></a>Do you use both conventional and American spelling for
                    your Google Adwords?</h2>
                <p>Did you know that all pilots around the world must speak English? Back then the decision of what language to use, was made as English, since the US invented the first plane. Like the sky, in the web world, it is better to use one version of English. Since the US invented the web, let's go with that. </p>
                <ul>
                 If you are an Australian or British this rule is controversial, but it is worth it for the following reasons:
                  <li>Cater for the majority. Most web traffic is from American users and they expect American (most probably will assume it is an error)</li>
                  <li>On the practical side, more web searches are going to be returned for US spelling of words.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>'Don't forget <a href="/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterTechnicalDocumentation.aspx#WordSpellingAndGrammarChecker">after making edits to check your pages for spelling errors</a>.'</p>
                <p>
                    At SSW we have a Google Adwords account that allows us to reach a targeted audience
                    based on the keywords they use to search the Internet. While testing the effectiveness
                    of the keywords in our Adwords account, we realised that if we use Australian spelling
                    a lot of our US customers won't find us, and vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus if you are using Adwords or a similar system, it's a good idea to include all
                    variations on the spelling of a word to ensure you don't miss out on any potential
                    customers. The beauty of the system is that if nobody searches on a word it doesn't
                    cost you a cent, so it makes sense to include as many as possible!</p>

                <p>
                    Being an Aussie this rule is controversial but we feel that it is worth it for the
                    following reasons. We regularly use web traffic analysis to monitor who is using
                    our web site and most of our users are American. We want our website to cater to
                    the majority of our users. For this reason we use American spelling on our site.
                    Phonetically it makes more sense.</p>

                    which resulted in a $90M settlement by Google, we put in place redirect files to
                    keep track of the amount of clicks obtained from our Adwords. Up until April 2006,
                    we were led to believe that the amount of clicks Google were specifying were the
                    number of clicks we were receiving. How wrong we were! After implementing the redirect
                    files, we quickly learnt that the number of clicks of one of our campaigns was incorrect
                    and we were being overcharged.</p>
                <p>
                    By implementing <a href="/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesNavigation.aspx#ManageExternalLinks">
                        redirect files</a>, we can keep track of exactly how many clicks are being generated
                    by our Adwords. Hence, we can see which campaigns are more effective and just as
                    importantly, we can keep track of exactly how much we should be charged for this.

                    paraphernalia as you walk down the street, it's good business sense to use your
