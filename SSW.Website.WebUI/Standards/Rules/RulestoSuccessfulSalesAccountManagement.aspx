    <p>You can have the best developers in the world, but if you haven't got a good sales process, no-one will ever use them.
        It's up to the Sales Manager to get this right.</p>
    <p>Once you've got the job, software projects are delicate activities and the client needs love. 
        It's up to the Account Managers to keep everyone on the same page.</p>
    <p>Here are SSW's rules for better Sales and Account Management.</p>

                <h2>Do you manage your inbound leads effectively?</h2>
                <p>With the amount of money companies spend on marketing these days, it's vital that when you receive a phone call enquiring about your services you know how to handle it.</p>
                <p>
                    Be prepared for <a href="/SSW/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterInboundCalls.aspx#Preparation"> inbound calls</a>. At SSW we have a script our phone operators keep close at
                    hand to make sure we ask the necessary qualifying questions. Qualifying a lead means
                    categorizing them - we use a 1 - 5 scale, just like hurricanes. 1 means a client
                    who wants a $500 website, and 5 means a custom application solution for a large
                    company. The aim is to determine if we are a good match with the prospect - that
                    way we don't spend time on dead ends and can give all time to the most likely leads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have qualified the lead, your aim for the remainder of the call should be
                    to arrange a face-to-face Initial Meeting with the client. Our preference is for
                    the Client to come to us. Think of this office as our showroom. Seeing it will reinforce
                    for the client that we are a real business, not just a voice on the other end of
                    the phone. If its more convenient for the Client for us to visit them, we are happy
                    to accommodate. Send this email <a href="../templates/BriefProposal-PreInitialMeeting.docx"
                        target="blank">Pre Initial Meeting</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have agreed on a time for the appointment, you send an appointment to the
                    client and everyone who will be attending the meeting, including the notes from
                    the phone call in the body of the appointment request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the off chance that the client wants to commence ad-hoc work (e.g. Consulting)
                    without a meeting, you should immediately <a href="#BindingWrittenClientContract">enter
                        a contract</a> with the client.

                    Do you rank your prospects?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you do not have a system for ranking all the potential clients who come knocking on your door, you will be open to accepting a troublesome client or two and a whole heap of headaches.
                    You could ask if they have any references from other companies, but a less drastic, and less confrontational check is a quick Google search.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do they turn up in the results? </li>
                        <li>Do they have a webpage? </li>
                        <li>Does the webpage look legitimate (not just thrown together)? </li>
                        <li>Is the "Contact Us" Address and/or phone number the same as the one they provided? </li>
                        <li>Do they have any references from other companies? </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
					With this information you can then rank them from "Not a Risk" all the way up to "Huge Risk" (the kind with neon flashing lights and all) and decide whether or not to go ahead with the business deal.

                <p>
                    Be prepared for the initial meeting because first impressions are the most important.
                    Preparation cements your professionalism and underscores SSW's eye for detail and
                    capacity to deliver. Preparing for the meeting includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensuring the sales staff attending the meeting are familiar with the relevant technologies.</li>
                    <li>Reviewing the clients website or other available information, taking special note
                        nature of the clients business. It's also useful to remember the office locations
                        (e.g. one office, nationwide or international) and the year of commencement of business</li>
                    <li>Reviewing any specification documents the client may have provided. You may conclude
                        the current specs are incomplete and further work is required to develop a Release
                        Plan</li>
                    <li>Have the standard SSW sample apps VPC to show SSW developed websites, windows apps
                        and our products (Client Demo VPC)</li>
                    <li>Having a wireless card to access the Internet if you cannot connect to the clients
                        network. In fact it is preferred you do not connect to the clients network due to
                        time and security issues</li>
                    <li>Having the <a href="/SSW/Company/SSWPresentation_ver4-5.pptx" target="blank">
                        standard sales presentation</a>. Remember, while clients don't want to
                        think this is you first job, they rarely like to listen to how many CommBanks, NRMAs
                        or Pfizers you've done work for. Clients generally prefer the focus of the meeting
                        to be their business. You will however consider any previous projects which bear similarities
                        to the project on offer, you do need to prove our competency</li>
                    <li>Have all the information that was recorded during the <a href="/SSW/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterInboundCalls.aspx#Preparation">

                    Meetings - Do you know the agenda for the initial meeting?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first meeting is on us. While SSW has 1 - 2 hours to provide the prospective
                    client with enough information to decide whether to pursue a Spec Review, the focus
                    of the initial meeting is to be the client, their problem, and how SSW might build
                    a solution. The best way to action this is to ask questions, listen and take notes:
                    clients appreciate someone genuinely considering their needs. A brainstorming session
                    is a fantastic way to give and receive feedback immediately. Even if the client
                    decides not to use SSW we like to leave them with useful information and a positive
                    impression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the initial meeting is to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Listen - Understand the clients motivation for engaging software consultants. We all know
                        clients 'want some software application built', but understanding the motivation
                        for getting that software built will assist you in making a successful bid for the
                        project. Three examples could be: to replace an outdated, hard to maintain existing
                        system core to the business; building new 'nice-to-have' functionality to allow
                        the client to offer a new service to the market; or assisting a start-up company
                        with a speculative venture. This also allows you to prioritise the clients importance</li>
                    <li>Listen - Understand the 'pain level' of the client</li>
                    <li>Listen - Determine whether scope, time, quality or cost has the highest priority for the
                        client and what level of project management they require. E.g. if a project must
                        be delivered by June 30, a high level of management will be required to ensure enough
                        resources are supplied to achieve this</li>
                    <li>Listen - Understand as much as you can about the processes/business rules the system has
                        to manage. Every level of detail you can correctly comprehend and confirm back builds
                        your credibility as a good communicator, and supplier!</li>
                    <li>Listen - Assess the overall scope of the project, i.e. is this is 'small', 'medium' or 'large'
                        project. The attending architect should start guessing how many man months this project
                        might be. This information will help you assess how long the spec review should be.
                        These initial thoughts should not be shared with the client at this stage as they
                        are most likely incorrect!</li>
                    <li>Listen - Determine the clients budget and who controls that budget. E.g. are you dealing
                        with the business owner or a line manager in a corporation? Do they have a fixed
                        amount to spend? Do they have a time period to spend it in?</li>
                    <li>Listen - Find out if this is the sort of project you can do and want to do</li>
                    <li>Listen - Qualify the client to make sure they can afford what they want</li>
                    <li>Consider technology options</li>
                    <li>Introduce the SSW team, show the presentation if appropriate, offer how our involvement
                        can help them, and whether we have a 'good fit'.</li>
                    <li>Explain SSW rates, including pre-paid</li>
                    <li>Explain the strengths and challenges of a Time and Materials or Fixed Price approaches</li>
                    <li>Explain our development method including the importance of a Specification Review</li>
                    <li>Take exceptional notes</li>
                    <li>Ask for the sale: "This project is right up our alley and we'd love to be involved,
                        is there anything stopping us from scheduling a <a href="http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulestoSuccessfulSalesAccountManagement.aspx#first-date">
                        Specification Review</a>?" This will focus the mind of the client on the next step</li>

                <h2>Meetings - What are the outcomes from your initial meeting? Spec Review or Ad Hoc work?</h2>
                <h4>Schedule a Specification Review</h4>

                <p>
                    For almost all projects, there is a need for additional requirements gathering.
                    Some clients don't have any kind of specification, while the specifications we are
                    given are sometimes lacking in detail or incomplete. Accordingly, before SSW can
                    provide a ballpark price for completing the project there is a another step which
                    requires engagement of SSW resources - the specification review.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is the responsibility of the Account Manager during the initial meeting to present
                    the benefits for the prospective client of an SSW specification review. Following
                    the initial meeting the Account Manager will send <a href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Management/RulesToBeingSoftwareConsultants-DealingWithClients/Pages/BriefProposalOrSpecificationReview.aspx" target="_blank">Brief Proposal</a> in the form of an <a href="../templates/BriefProposalPostInitialMeeting.doc"
                        target="blank">Post initial meeting</a> email through to the prospective client for SSW to conduct a specification review. It may be necessary to conduct a second initial meeting with a technical specialist attending as well.
                </p>
                <p>Some clients require more information on how SSW will complete the project before making a decision to go ahead with the specification review. The sales people are to reinforce the importance of the spec review and at this time. There will be some prospects where you are at a stale mate, the sales person is to make the decision whether an extra 4 hours will be spent investigating the solution before the ballpark is given.</p>
                <p>A sales person has 16 hours per month of developer time they can invest into this pre-sales investigation, so this time has to be used wisely.</p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    In the event the work is thought to be less than 3 developer days and the scope
                    is well understood, it may be worthwhile for the developers to commence work straight
                    away without a Specification Review. Normal standards for work should be followed,
                    such as <a href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/MorningGoals.aspx">morning
                        goals</a>. This type of work is called 'ad-hoc' work. If during the course of
                    ad-hoc work it is discovered the work will take longer than 3 days, work must stop
                    immediately with a written request for a specification review, even if it is only
                    brief.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may also immediately commence ad-hoc work if the client is a technical client
                    and SSW is providing resources for an existing project under the sole direction
                    of the client.

                <h2>
                    Do you enter into a binding written contract with a client before doing any billable
                    work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Before SSW engages in any billable work the two parties must enter into a binding
                    written contract. This ensures contractual obligations are clear on both sides,
                    mitigating the potential for disagreements down the line and protecting both SSW
                    and the client in the event of a disagreement. Binding contracts can take the form
                    of Terms and Conditions, Release Plans, Emails and Instant Messenger and or even verbal
                    agreements.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong></li>
                    <p>
                        A signed copy of <a href="/SSW/Standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx">
                            SSW standard Terms and Conditions</a> are mandatory before billable work commences
                        as they explain the terms on which SSW works and the rates which will be billed.
                        Some clients may also have their own set of Terms and Conditions which SSW will
                        consider signing if agreeable to SSW. It is also common for clients to ask SSW to
                        sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) which SSW will always consider.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Long term clients should resign the Terms and Conditions every year. Signed Terms
                        and Conditions should be given to SSW Accounts department for record keeping.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Generally speaking a signed set of Terms and Conditions authorizes SSW to conduct
                        a Specification Review.
                    </p>
                    <li><strong>Proposals and Release Plans</strong></li>
                    <p>
                        At the conclusion of a <a href="http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/SpecificationReview.aspx">Specification Review</a> SSW will provide an Initial Release
                        Plan proposal to the client. The proposal will include all the relevant information
                        SSW has discovered during the Specification Review process. The proposal may take
                        the form of a PowerPoint presentation (preferred) or Word doc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However the proposal is not a contract. It does not supersede the Terms and Conditions. In effect 
                        the Proposal is a sales document which describes broadly the scope of the work to be done and SSW's
                        capacity to complete that work. It is not a working document from which the project is managed. 
                        The project will be managed using Release Plans which are the living documentation of the project.
                        Release Plans are required to be approved and signed by clients.
                    </p>
                    <li><strong>Ad Hoc Emails, Instant Messenger and Verbal Agreements</strong></li>
                    <p>
                        Electronic communication such as email and Instant Messenger are extremely useful
                        in getting decisions confirmed quickly but it is important to follow strict standards
                        to ensure any agreements are clear to everyone. SSW does not generally rely upon
                        verbal agreements, always confirming anything agreed verbally in writing. The following
                        are important rules to follow:
                    </p>
                    </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/PrepareAndConfirm.aspx">Do you
                    prepare then confirm conversations/decisions?</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/EmailToMyself.aspx">Do you send
                    yourself emails?</a></li>

                    Do you confirm important IM chats by email</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Email, Instant Messenger and (confirmed) verbal agreements are utilized extensively
                during a project where newly discovered work, delays, or other work outside the
                initial scope is required. SSW may use <a href="/SSW/ExtremeEmails">Extreme Emails</a>
                to manage this process.

                <h2>
                    Do you present project proposals as lots of little releases rather than one big price?</h2>

                   <p>
                When a prospective client gets a quote for a huge price it's like giving them a slap in the face.
                Break your proposals into a series of <a href="http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/InitialReleasePlanandBallpark.aspx">releases</a> and 
                clients can choose to proceed with a smaller financial committment (such as just getting the mockups 
                done) than if they were committing to the whole project. Often, small financial commitments will 
                lead to bigger ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach also allows you to side-step common delaying tactics of prospective clients by making it easier to 
                    get the project moving.

                <p>So you had a good <a href="">initial meeting</a> (like a 1st coffee with a new girl), and you have agreed to have 
                    a Specification Review (aka first date).</p>
                <p> For the majority of new clients, a <a href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/SpecificationReview.aspx">
                    Specification Review</a> (also known as a Spec Review) will be your 1st paid engagement with them. This is to work out the requirements, 
                    and put together a broad time and cost estimate.</p>
                <p>The process:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once you have decided that this is a project you want to work on, you have to convince the client to book in a Spec Review
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is a 1-5 day exercise for 1-2 people. The general rule is 1 man day per expected 2 week sprint.</li>
                            <li>This process is timeboxed, and so appears to the client as a fixed price.</li>

                    <li>You will create a backlog of tasks, and some form of document (word or ppt) to present to the client explaining your proposed approach.</li>
                    <li>Present the Spec Review results to the client (in a meeting with all stakeholders) on site if possible, 
                        or over the phone if not, but never just by email.</li>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Keep your current clients happy</b></p>
                <p>
                    We have received feedback from larger clients in the past that they expect regular
                    checkups and guidance from senior staff. A nice informal way to arrange this is
                    to buy your client lunch one a month. You can review the project for half an hour,
                    then grab a bite to eat. The review should cover the project as a whole, any niggling
                    problems, and discuss any upcoming projects. We do this review free of charge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Project Manager, one of the most important things you should focus on to keep
                    clients happy is <i>communication</i>. For active clients, a week must not pass
                    without a phone call or some other contact. A lot of the time this will be emails
                    from the developer. Almost all disputes arise when you don't speak to a client for
                    a period of time. This allows any annoyances to fester and any misunderstandings
                    can turn into real problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A &quot;client relationship problem&quot; is when you have said &quot;no&quot; to
                    a client and and they let you know that they strongly disagree. In that case:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tell them the reasons for your stand</li>
                    <li>Tell them that developers will sometimes do the wrong thing - clients have different
                        opinions of what that is</li>
                    <li>Tell them you are authorized to split a problem,offer them the solution and ask if they
                        are happy with that solution</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If they're still not happy you may need to refer them up the chain of authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Stay in touch with past clients</b></p>
                <p>
                    Have a system in place that allows you to stay in touch with past clients,
                    even ones we may not have spoken to in a while: send a useful newsletter
                    to subscribers so your business keeps fresh in their mind. That way when they suddenly
                    realise that they need some work done, you're right at the top of the list. Secondly,
                    have a follow up system in place so that client get a call every 3 months
                    after a job is completed. Make it friendly, not pushy.
                    You should use a line like 'I'm just checking in to see if everything is still running
                    smoothly.' Setting up a system like this will result in more repeat business and
                    less need to spend money on marketing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always be interested in your clients' lives outside of work: find out about their hobbies, sports interests, 
                    kids etc. If you come up with the perfect idea for a present for an important client, get it approved by 
                    your manager and send it off.

                <h2>
                    Do you know how to manage objections?</h2><a name="ManageObjections"></a>
                <p>
                    When attempting to sell a solution to a potential client, you will invariably come
                    up against some objections. It is essential that you are prepared to handle these
                    objections so the client is confident in your skills and has no reservations about
                    choosing you over someone else. The main reason clients raise objections is because
                    they have concerns about your experience "fit" with their needs.</p>
                <p>
                    We recommend you use this objection handling model.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ask the question - "What concerns do you have about working with us?"</li>
                    <li>Acknowledge the objection - say, "Thanks for raising that", or, "Thanks for letting
                        us know about that"</li>
                    <li>Probe - ask, "Can I ask you a few questions about the concerns that you have?"</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"If I could resolve this issue for you, could we move forward?"</li>
                        <li>You can't always solve objections on the spot - it's ok to say, "is it alright if
                            i speak to one of my developers about it and let you know about that today?"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Answer - Pick the best response to their objection (see below)</li>
                    <li>Confirm that they are happy with your answer - "Do you now feel comfortable with
                        our approach towards your project?"</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Because we follow extreme programming, a typical objection we get is - "Why do you
                    put 2 developers on the project? This is going to be more expensive isn't it?".
                    This is basically how we handle this question:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Explain the benefits:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"We can typically complete the project sooner. Is that important to you?"</li>
                        <li>You get more expertise - One guy is more focussed on UI, the other guy is stronger
                            with database</li>
                        <li>You get better quality code because the guys are able to "put their heads together"
                            to solve a problem - this saves maintenance costs down the track</li>
                        <li>We can continue working if 1 guy gets sick</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>If they are still unsure, you can offer a small discount off the hourly rate, or
                        offer some free support - it's all about managing risk.</li>
                </ul>

                    Do you know when and when not to give away products?</h2>
                <p>
                    We DON'T charge clients when an SSW developer uses an SSW product as part of the
                    toolkit he takes(e.g. we use Upsizing PRO when doing an upsizing job). This
                    is because it's just like a plumber <a href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/ToolBox.aspx">
                        using his wrench</a>. The developer takes it away with him when he leaves.</p>
                        <p>
                            We DO charge clients when an SSW developer installs or provides an SSW product for
                            the ongoing use of the client e.g. Code Auditor, Team Calendar or Extreme Emails,
                            which the client's staff will use after SSW leaves. This is just like a plumber
                            buying a particular piece of pipe to fix a sink. SSW
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SSW does not discount product prices to clients. This devalues the product.

                <p>
                    We should try to never discount our price at SSW. Instead we should be adding value

                <h2>
                    Do you inform the client of any resource or rate changes?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An important source of comfort for any client is a feeling that they are in control and they know
                    the basicis of what is going on. The fundamental part of this is who is working for them and how 
                    much is it costing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, if you change the developers on a project or if one or more of their rates change, it is 
                    very important to inform the client, before sending them the next invoice, where they will find out 
                    and could think that you're being shifty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At SSW, we have standard templates for these situations in our CRM. You can see an example here:

                    <p>
                        Thanks for choosing SSW's software services. Just to let you know that Eric was promoted to Solution Architect earlier this year. We held back his rate change until the end of this phase of the project, but we will be implementing his new rate as of 9/10/2009. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His new standard rate is $245/hour+GST. Don't forget SSW offers a competitive rate to those clients pre-paying time in blocks of 40 hours per Project Team Member. You can find more information here: http://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Products/ProdCategory.aspx?CategoryID=5CONS 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I trust you've been happy with Eric's contribution to your project so far. We look forward to working with you soon.

             sure they're happy?</h2>
             <p>
                It's important for Account Managers to stay involved with client projects past the 
                sales stage and into the implementation stage. The best way to do this is to call 
                them once every 2 months or so once the project gets going, just to gage their 
                overall satisfaction and happiness.
             </p>
             <p>
                We find that the best way to set you reminders to do this is using your CRM system. 
                For every project, set a phone call about 2 months after the project starts, and 
                then set another one 2 months after that once you've made that call, etc.

             <p>
                Sometimes the prospect is not ready at the end of the initial meeting to engage you for a 
                spec review or ad-hoc work. Even if this is the case, it's really important you leave 
                the meeting with a crystal clear future about the next stage and when that will be.
                Every prospect needs an intelligently scheduled follow-up activity (preferrably in CRM).
             </p>
             <p>
                So, at the end, ask the prospect:

                      "Cool, Do you want to send the appointment or should I?"
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                       Figure: Good example: Asking them lots of questions and setting a specific time and date for the next meeting (or phone call)
                    </dd>
                </dl> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will ensure that the follow up meeting or phone call gets a much better chance of 
                    happening... Basically the prospect set this up and will feel a certain indirect obligation.

             <h2><a name="BookInAdvance"></a>Do you book in a minimum of 1 day's work at a time?</h2>
             <p>Small increments of work add a lot of administrative overhead to work, drastically reducing company profit from client work. As a general rule, make sure any billable client appointment has a 1 day minimum and should preferably be in day long increments.</p>

                <p>Any opportunity that has not yet been converted to a sale will be at one of the following 6 stages:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Initial Phone Call
                        <ul>

                            <li>You've arranged an initial meeting and it's booked in</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Follow Up Meeting &#8211; Booked
                        <ul>
                            <li>In some cases, more than one initial meeting may be required before work or speccing commences</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Spec Review Proposal &#8211; Waiting for Approval
                        <ul>
                            <li>After the initial meeting, if the work requires it, a specification review is proposed</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Spec Review &#8211; Booked
                        <ul>
                            <li>The speccing phase has been approved and booked in</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Project Proposal &#8211; Waiting for Approval
                        <ul>
                            <li>After the spec review, the client has been given a proposal for a chunk of work. Once this is approved, the opportunity is closed as won</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2><a name="follow-up-course-attendees"></a>Do you follow up course attendees for consulting work?</h2>
                <p>Running training courses can be a great way to make sure your site always has new content and showing that your company is active publicly and so is good for branding, and it can also be a great source of lead generation for consulting work.</p>
                <p>In order to capitalise on this, you should have a developer in any training course who is there to help out and get to know the attendees, whose job it will be to meet up with some of the attendees a couple of weeks after the course to catch up for a coffee and a chat. This could be the speaker or another personable developer if required. It&#8217;s important that this is not just a sales person, as it needs to be someone who can give further advice on the training topic at a later date if needed.</p>
                <p>Keep these meetings fairly informal, with the agenda basically consisting of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How did you find the course?</li>
                    <li>Is there any way we could improve it?</li>
                    <li>What are you doing with what you learned?</li>
                    <li>Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to know?</li>
                    <li>Does your company have a need for any consulting work?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The last question is key as it could lead to substantially more work, but you should make sure the person you&#8217;re meeting with gets some good value out of the meeting itself, so this does not just seem like a sales exercise.</p>
                <p>It's also a good idea to mention that this will happen at the end of the course so that the call doesn't come out of the blue. The speaker could say something like:</p>
                <div class="greyBox">
                    <p><em>"Thanks for attending today. You can email either of us after this.<br />
                    Also in the next few weeks 5 of you will be picked at random for a 'Retro Coffee'<br />
                    It is about 20 mins. Bring your problems. We will chat about the course and what you still need to know."</em></p>
                </div>
