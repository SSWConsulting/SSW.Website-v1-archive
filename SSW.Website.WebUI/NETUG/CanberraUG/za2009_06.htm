	A smart developer stands on the shoulders of the giants that came before. Windows 7 is just around the corner. 
	As a platform, it boasts a number of differentiating features that you as a developer can exploit for no additional 
	charge. Come along to this demo-heavy exploration of the platform and the tools you need to make it shine. We’ll 
	also have copies of the Release Candidate version of Windows 7 to distribute.<br/>
