<p>The evening meeting is being held on THURSDAY 20th March from 4.30pm to 6pm.</p> 
<p>Agenda:</p>
<ul>
	<li>20 mins - Pizza, Coke and Networking</li>
	<li>45 mins - ASP.NET MVC Preview 2, Presented by Tatham Oddie<br/>
	What is this whole MVC thing anyway? Hot on the heels of MIX08 and last week’s release of ASP.NET 
	MVC Preview 2, Tatham Oddie will demonstrate how to use the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern to 
	take advantage of your favourite .NET Framework language for writing business logic in a way that 
	is de-coupled from the views of the data. We’ll discuss the advantages to MVC on the web, the other 
	frameworks that are available, and build an app with it - all in 45 minutes.  </li>
	<li>20 minutes - Internet Explorer 8 for Developers, Presented by Tatham Oddie<br/>
	The release of Internet Explorer 8 Beta 1 demonstrates some exciting new technologies for developers. 
	These technologies are open standards, and implementations are already being worked on in the Firefox 
	and Safari camps too. In 20 minutes we’ll do a lap of activities, WebSlices and the new debugging tools.</li>
	<li>10 mins - Question time (timeframes for lunch will be 10 mins, 45 mins, 0 mins, 5 mins respectively)</li>
