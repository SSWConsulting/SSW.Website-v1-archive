	<li>60 mins - Team Foundation Server (TFS) for Successful Project Management by 
	<a href="http://www.AdamCogan.com/">Adam Cogan</a><br />
	Visual Studio Team System (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) provide tools, templates and reports to 
	help you monitor and support your software development processes. TFS is an advanced source and work item 
	tracking system that easily allows you to create and assign work items such as tasks and bugs as well as 
	allowing you to automate builds and extensive reporting capabilities. TFS can provide metrics that 
	indicate project health, code auditing and releases are more easily monitored. VSTS is designed to help address many of 
	these traditional problems faced by project managers. It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to 
	help teams improve their software development activities and to help project managers better support the 
	software development processes.<br/>
	During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating work items and tracking of releases using 
	Visual Studio Team System and Team Foundation Server. Key areas include Process management, Security 
	and permissions, Centralized work item management, Microsoft Office Excel and Microsoft Office Project 
	integration, Metrics and reporting as well as the Project portals available on SharePoint.
