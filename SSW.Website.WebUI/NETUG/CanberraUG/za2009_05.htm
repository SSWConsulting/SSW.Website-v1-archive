<p style="font-weight:bold">Canberra .NET User Group</p>
<p>You are cordially invited to the MAY meetings of the Canberra .NET Developers User Group.</p>
<p>The lunch time meeting is being held on MONDAY 18th May from 12.30pm to 1.30pm.</p>
<p>The evening meeting is being held on MONDAY 18th May from 4.30pm to 6pm.</p> 
<p>Agenda:</p>
<ul>
	<li>20 mins - Pizza, Coke and Networking</li>
	<li>60 mins - Something About Mary (SharePoint and Office 2007) by 
	<a href="http://www.AdamCogan.com/">Adam Cogan</a><br />
	Come see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint and Office for Mary and the other knowledge workers.<br/>
	First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your business.<br/>
	Then see real world examples of:
	<ul>
		<li>Using SharePoint 2007 and Office 2007 together</li>
		<li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
		<li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by</li>
		<li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to improve visibility/searchability/versioning across the company</li>
		<li>Overview of how data can be synchronised between the two (eg using Access and Excel)</li>
		<li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means</li>
		<li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint</li>
		<li>High level examples of using/integrating Office with other products (eg VSTS integration with Outlook)</li>
		<li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>
		<li>Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations (eg the 
		<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/sharepoint/">Atlassian SharePoint Connector</a> and 
		<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/office/">Office Connector</a>)</li>
	</ul>
	The session will be informal so there's plenty of opportunities for asking questions. This is a good chance for you to consider 
	new ways of using Office in your company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session because too often 
	companies limit Office to just an email application, word processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it 
	can have on the entire business process.
