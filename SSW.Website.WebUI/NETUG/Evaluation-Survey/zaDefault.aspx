    <h2>The User Group</h2>
    <p>Every month, SSW hosts the Sydney .NET User Group where developers meet to exchange ideas and listen to presentations by local and international industry experts. Topics focus on .NET development, SharePoint, Xamarin, Cordova and general ALM strategies . We also love discussing the latest industry news and exciting new trends.</p>
