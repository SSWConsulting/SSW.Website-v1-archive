In the application lifecycle management tooling space the current offerings are disparate at best ?requiring tools on tools to achieve productivity. Visual Studio Team System 2010 in conjunction with Team Foundation Server attempts to rectify this by unifying the underlying flow of information between design, development and test disciplines. In this session Stephen Godbold will highlight the enhancements made to the Team System offering that will drive up quality through a single source of truth and a shared application view across teams. He will demonstrate how this relates to you and your team by walking through the lifecycle of a bug in a typical application from discovery during testing to analysis, solution design, fix, and quality management before release.</p>

                <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://wardyit.com/blog">Peter Ward</a></p>
                 
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Backup and Restore commands are the most important SQL Server commands in a Database Administrators arsenal. In the event of a system failure or user error, the Backup and Restore commands provide the ability to recover from what otherwise could be a catastrophe. With the release of SQL server 2005 and 2008 these commands have been enhanced significantly. For example, the ability to take an adhoc backup without affecting the restore sequence and the ability to revert a database from a snapshot. In this session you will see how to utilise many of the new recovery features as part of your SQL Server business continuity strategy.</p>

                <p><strong>Description:</strong> When working with databases, we often need to create some administrative pages to do all our CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations on the tables. This can be a long and repetitive process if you don't use a code generator. Thankfully in Visual Studio 2008 SP1 Dynamic data allows us to create all those pages without writing a single line of code! In this session you will also find out how to customize these admin pages with different looks and data entry controls.</p>
                <p><strong>About the Presenter:</strong> A geek at heart that loves to learn and play with new technologies.

                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Most developers have this obsession with building applications that connect directly to a database. Whether they are a web application or a rich client application, connecting directly or via a web service, the reality is that these applications need to be served with a reliable connection. Using some of the latest additions to the .NET Framework this session will walk you through building applications that will continue to work long after your connection drops out. You’ll see how easily the ADO.NET Synchronisation Services can be configured to establish a local cache for your data and how the Client Application Services will help you extend your existing security infrastructure to include your occasionally connected application.</p>

                <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Greg Harris</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The presenters will develop a simple line of business application in both Flex and Silverlight, the two leading Rich Internet Application (RIA) development environments. These applications will show:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Basic page design and layout</li>
                        <li>Data entry and validation process</li>
                        <li>Communications back to the server</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>From this, the attendee will be able to compare the advantages of these two RIA environments side by side.</p>
                <p>Silverlight is Microsoft's new cross-platform browser plug-in. This provides RIA user experiences utilising core dot NET common language runtime functionality within the browser. This means that windows style applications are able to run from within the browser. Silverlight also supports many rich media display options, such as vector graphics, animation and audiovisual playback.</p>
                <p>Silverlight is radically changing the RIA landscape. Currently there are 1.5 million Silverlight downloads a day, this technology will be used by NBC for Internet streaming video coverage of the Beijing Olympic Games.</p>
                <p>Silverlight competes in the same space as Adobe Flash / Flex.</p>
                <p>Presenting the Silverlight component of the presentation will be Greg Harris, an independent consultant/developer specialising in Microsoft tools. His recent focus has been on the new Silverlight tool set. Greg will be sharing knowledge recently acquired at conferences during March.</p>
                <p>Presenting the Flex component of the presentation will be Flex experts Peter Davey and Max Nyman. Peter and Max have extensive Flex development experience in Australia and internationally.</p>

            <h3>Social Engineering with Facebook API using Visual Studio 2008</h3>
                <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Tom Gao</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Facebook platform is currently valued at 10 billion dollars with over 40 million users registering within the last year alone. It is predicted to overtake myspace in the next year or so. In my work as the National Technical Director at EuroRSCG we’re required to meet an increasing demand to develop applications for social networks such as Facebook. This is because although Internet and online advertising is still the heart of most ‘online’ business . Today industry leaders in marketing such as Sony, Tony Ferguson and Veet are recognizing that the real ‘gold’ in advertising is not through pushing end users to use a product that they know little about or bringing a banner in front of their face but through word of mouth. The reality of the matter is if my friends have added a Facebook application and have sent me action item on Facebook. The psychology of ignoring such an action item would be anti-social. This has been the driving factor in the success to facebook applications.
                <p>Materials that will be presented include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Explanation to the Facebook architecture & framework</li>
                        <li>Facebook security and limitations</li>
                        <li>ASP.NET Facebook API</li>
                        <li>Facebook Markup Language (FBML)</li>
                        <li>Facebook javascript (yes, specific to facebook)</li>
                        <li>Facebook application development through iframe</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>During the presentation I will be running through live examples in developing facebook applications for both Windows Application and Web Application. In Windows application development example application will actually be tapping into the API to retrieve individual profile, friends' information live from facebook. In web application we will attempt to create a live facebook application during the presentation through both FBML and Facebook IFrame approach.</p>

            <h3>We work efficiently on the right things in a visible way? Looking at processes and tracking and time systems</h3>
                <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Mark Hetherington</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Every IT development group gets criticised by its customers (internal and external) for not getting their priorities right and not being open about what they are actually doing. If your group all worked as efficiently as possible, on precisely the things that your customer wanted in the right priority order in such a visible way that your customer could change priority and know all the impacts, it would be virtually impossible for the customer to be critical. While it's probably impossible to develop and execute all the processes to achieve this, we can get very close and have a lot of fun and pride doing so.
This talk is all about having all tracking and development information in one integrated system that does not include email. Emails should not contain information that needs to be referenced and should not be used for discussion; it is a good medium for reminders but anything useful in them should be moved to the integrated system. From one end of the spectrum a business stakeholder (customer) should be able to view the work in progress starting from a high level e.g. drilling down into a programme and see any amount of detail they wish. Similarly, a developer should be able to view what they are working on and then link up to the associated requirements and programme giving the reason for each task. Every bit of time worked by anybody should also be recorded on the system for both accounting and historical reasons. These figures can then be used for changing strategy (e.g. spend more on support and less on development) and for helping future estimates and planning.
Having tried a variety of open source, commercial and home-grown systems, the presenter has chosen a combination of Jira and Confluence (both provided by Atlassian) and SVN. While these products are not the only solution, they demonstrate how well the processes of an organisation can be modelled and tracked. We are not talking bug tracking here, we are talking about tracking everything everybody needs and does. Each member of the company has a personal dashboard showing them their work outstanding together with priorities, dependencies, time estimates and due dates.

             <h3>Web-Scale Computing</h3>
                <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Mike Culver</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> What’s possible in a post Web 2.0 world? Innovation continues at a mind-bending pace, and this presentation will showcase some thought-provoking new directions that Web Services are headed in (imagine computers programmatically calling people to perform tasks), as well as introduce a concept known as “Web Scale Computing? The presentation will also provide an overview of Amazon Web Services, and feature a code demonstration showing how .NET developers are able to easily integrate data storage in the sky as part of an ASP.NET application.
More importantly, it’s an opportunity for an interactive discussion about what the future, shaped by Web services and Web Scale Computing, looks like.
Amazon spent over 11 years and over $2 billion developing a world-class technology and content platform that powers Amazon web sites for millions of customers. Most people think "Amazon.com" when they hear the word; however developers are excited to learn that there is a separate technology arm of the company, known as Amazon Web Services or AWS. Using AWS, developers can build software applications leveraging the same robust, scalable, and reliable technology that powers Amazon’s retail business. AWS has now launched ten services with open API’s for developers to build applications, with the result that over 290,000 developers have registered on Amazon’s developer site to create applications based on these services.
Mike Culver joined Amazon Web Services after almost eight years in evangelism at Microsoft, where he saw .NET move from a provocative idea to the preeminent development platform for serious development.
As an Amazon Evangelist, Mike works in the Developer Relations Group of Amazon Web Services. In that capacity he once again helps developers take advantage of cutting-edge technologies that are going to change the way we think about computer applications.</p>

Steve is a frequent and popular speaker at conferences worldwide, often appearing Asia one week and Europe the next. When not evangelizing the benefits of Microsoft security technology, he spends time with customers to better understand the security pain they face and show how some of that pain can be eliminated. Having been born with an Ethernet cable attached to his belly button, Steve grew up in networking and telecommunications; the simple telephone still provides endless hours of exploratory joy. Besides lurking in the Internet's dark alleys and secret passages, he enjoys mountain biking, clubbing and the occasional rave, freely sharing his opinions about the intersection of technology and culture, and hanging with his family and friends in the centre of the universe otherwise known as Seattle, Washington.</p>

                <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Johann Kruse</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Microsoft unified communications technologies tear down the walls that separate telecommunications and computing. And they do it with software that leverages your existing telecommunications infrastructure. Microsoft unified communications technologies are more than just VoIP. They break down all the traditional communications silos. Voicemail and faxes move over the network like email. They arrive in your Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 inbox where you can sort, prioritize, and forward them, just like any piece of email. And when you're on the road, you can dial in over any telephone to hear your emails and your calendars. You can even access your Microsoft Office Outlook directory and place calls from any telephone. Also hear about customising and extending the capabilities of the newly released Office Communicator 2007. The session will also cover the API solutions available to integrate Unified communications concepts into your line of business applications and business processes.</p>

            <h3>Domain Modelling</h3>
                <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Paul Stovell</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> When we design a solution, the architecture that we implement should act as a lever, allowing us to solve the increasingly complex problems we face with minimal effort. "Domain Modelling", the approach of designing applications by focussing on the natural needs of the problem domain, is one such lever; providing us with a solid, robust architecture that easily handles this ever-increasing complexity. 
                    In this session, Paul Stovell will describe a number of common but advanced domain modelling patterns, and demonstrate how they can be applied practically in .NET.</p>

            <h3>Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007</h3>
                <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Mike Fitzmaurice and Joel Oleson</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The May .NET User Group meeting will be a Q & A session with Mike Fitzmaurice and Joel Oleson, both Microsoft Technical Product Managers for SharePoint Products and Technologies. You might remember Joel from his hugely popular User Group presentation last September. By all accounts, this promises to be another "standing room only" event. Dave Glover will also be presenting Windows Powershell. </p>
                <p>Microsoft Windows PowerShell command line shell and scripting language helps IT Professionals and Developers achieve greater productivity and automation and runs on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server "Longhorn". The shell includes an interactive prompt and a scripting environment that can be used independently or in combination. Unlike most shells, which accept and return text, Windows PowerShell is built on top of the .NET common language runtime (CLR) and the .NET Framework, and accepts and returns .NET objects. This fundamental change in the environment brings entirely new tools and methods to the management and configuration of Windows, systems and business solutions. </p>
                <p>The session is very interactive, lots of demos including working with the new Office Open XML File Formats with PowerShell, very cool indeed!</p>
