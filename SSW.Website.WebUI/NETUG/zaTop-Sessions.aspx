    <strong>
        <p>Web security has come a long way in recent years.</p>
    </strong>
    <p>These days, there's a whole bunch of browser security features that can not only make your site more secure than ever, but make your job as a developer even easier. But the features remain largely unused with many developers not knowing of their existence nor how to properly leverage them.</p>
    <p>In this talk you'll see the mechanics of a whole bunch of acronyms you've probably never heard of before, but will witness firsthand as they're put into action. You'll see the attacks they prevents, how to implement them and ultimately, how they help better protect the apps you're building.</p>

    <p>In a special presentation at the Sydney .Net Users Group, Scott Hanselman talked openly and candidly about all things Microsoft, specifically on Windows Azure and Visual Studio 2013.</p>
    <p>You also see Hanselman dig into the open source SDKs of Windows Azure and discuss the future of Open Source. You'll see him access Azure from the command line and deploy and redeploy with Git. You'll see Scott fire up Linux VMs, setup Mongo and run node.js apps in the cloud. The presentations will also look at things like SendGrid and New Relic. The future of the cloud is open and it's a hybrid. Scott also discusses ways to penny pinch in the cloud and how our mindset needs to change if the cloud is to save us money.</p>
    <p>Scott takes a funny, interactive and entertaining approach to presenting in this video. It's a great watch for anyone who's into Microsoft technologies and wants to hear from someone who has deep and thoughtful insights in the future of Microsoft and the development world.</p>
