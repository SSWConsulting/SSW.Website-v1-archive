        <a name="adddomain"></a>Sub Domain Pointers
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sub domain name pointers resolve to the root level of your virtual server just like
        your original domain name. Sub domain pointers are an excellent way to drive more
        traffic to your website! Note: Domain pointers are to point to the main domain name,
        these cannot be setup as individual web sites residing in sub directories of your
        account.</p>
    <p>
        Examples are http://mail.ssw.com.au, http://accounts.ssw.com.au</p>
    <p>
        With the Bronze Hosting Plan your URL will appear as http://www.ssw.com.au/YourDomainName<br />

        <a name="xml"></a>XML Parser (Extensible Markup Language)</h2>
    <p>
        XML is a markup language for documents containing structured information. Structured
        information contains both content (words, pictures, etc.) and some indication of
        what role that content plays (for example, content in a section heading has a different
        meaning from content in a footnote, which means something different than content
        in a figure caption or content in a database table, etc.). Almost all documents
        have some structure. A markup language is a mechanism to identify structures in
        a document. The XML specification defines a standard way to add markup to documents.

        You will notice a little lock appear on the bottom of your browser when you visit
        a site with SSL encryption. This symbolises that everything on that page is totally
        secure.

            data will be stored across the other remaining drives.</li><li>On-site<br>
                We will configure SQL Agent to perform backups of the data (weekly) and log files
                (daily) onto the local PC. This means if you get a corruption SSW can restore the
                prior version of the data.</li><li>Off-Site<br>
                    We will take your back-up off-site on a weekly basis. This mean if a serious error
                    occurs like a double hard disk failure then SSW can restore the last off-site backup.
                    <br>
