                agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees, harmless from any claim or

                of Service, or your violation of any rights of another.<br />
                13. These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and SSW and
                govern your use of the SERVICE, superseding any prior agreements between you and

                and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of New South Wales,
                Australia. The failure of SSW to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
                Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any
                provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction
                to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to
                give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
                provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree
                that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action

                barred.<br />
                14. SSW will always keep our servers patched and up to date, which may mean some
                code may occasionally need to be updated to stay current. No development is covered
                by the hosting agreement, and as such, any development will be charged on a time
