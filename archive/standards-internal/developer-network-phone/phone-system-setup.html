              <a name="ZAPTrunk"> </a>
              How to create a ZAP trunk
            </h2>
            <p>
              ZAP Channel Module provides a layer between Asterisk and your
              zaptel device (some kind of telephony hardware that has drivers
              which support zaptel API). So ZAP trunk is usually used when you
              try to connect your machine to PSTN.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create a ZAP trunk, you only need to enter the "Trunks"
              section, and click "Add ZAP trunk". There are only two things to
              be care of, the dial rules (talk about it later) and the ZAP
              identifier.
            </p>
            <p>
              ZAP identifier is the group name of this trunk, e.g. ZAP/g0 stands
              for group 0. This can't be changed. You can create multiple trunks
              over the same outer line, but you have to keep the same identifier
              for everyone.
              <br />
              To get more info of the group configuration, you can read the file
              //PhoneSystemServer/etc/asterisk/zapata.conf. It is Asterisk
              configure file to read your hardware interface.
              <br />
              Another configure file you maybe touch is
              //PhoneSystemServer/etc/zaptel.conf. This file contains the
              interface configuration of your hardware card. You may need to
              modify this file manually when you add/remove a module on the
              card. There are always two types of interface you will face, FXO
              and FXS. FXS interface is the module you use to connect your
              server to PSTN, while FXO interface is the module you use to
              connect to some of your device which can response, like fax.

              How to create a SIP trunk
            </h2>
            <p>
              The SIP Channel Module enables Asterisk to communicate via VOIP
              with SIP telephones and exchanges. You will need to create such a
              trunk for using VOIP service.
              <br />
              To create a SIP trunk, you first need to get the username,
              password and server IP from your VOIP service provider. Then click
              "Add SIP trunk" in "Trunks" section. There you can set the dial
              rules and name this trunk, but the main point is the configuration
              of connection parameter.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Dial rule has its own patterns like regular expression. You can
              apply the same pattern to inbound/outbound route. These rules are
              applied after the outbound dial pattern. That means, if you dial
              912345678 and add a rule to remove 9 in the number in outbound
              route, the number passed to the trunk will be 12345678.
              <br />
              For the details of the rule's grammar, please see the outbound
              route section.

              To create a device, you will need to navigate to "Devices", and
              choose the type of device. For those IP phones and soft phone, we
              usually choose "Generic SIP Device". In the next page, you have to
              enter the device ID and secret. The device ID must be unique and
              digital only. It is also the phone number assigned to the device.
              Here you can also select the default user of this device, if you
              already have one.

            <p>
              After you click the "submit" button, you will find the device you

              you will see the detailed configuration. Please set the "nat" to "
              <red> no </red>
              " since we do not use NAT in our system.

              The configure page is different from the SIP's. The Device ID and
              channel is required. The channel is the FXO interface you will use
              to connect to your fax machine. You have to fill its id in this
              blank. The id is related to your telephony hardware and can be got
              from zaptel.conf.
              <br />
              The detailed configuration is generated automatically, so you
              needn't do anything there.

              Voice mail is already enabled in our system. When the call has not
              been answered for a period of time, the system will ask the caller
              to leave a message automatically. To set up a voice mail for
              special user, you can navigate to "Users", and then select the
              user name in the list. At the bottom of the page you will see a
              "voicemail &amp; directory" section.

              on the server. If you enable the email attachment, the voicemail
              file will be attached to the email. "Delete Vmail" means the
              voicemail record file will be deleted after sending the email.

              How to set up an outbound route
            </h2>
            <p>
              An outbound route is a collection of rules that redirect the calls
              to different trunks. You can create an outbound route via
              "outbound routes". Here you can create rules in the "Dial
              Patterns", one line for each, and set the sequence of trunks to
              catch the request in "Trunk Sequence". The request call number
              that matches the rules will go through the trunk in order, and the
              later trunk will be chose only when the former one is busy or
              unavailable.

            <p>
              The ring group describes the extension ring order when a call
              comes in.When you try to create a ring group, you must set the
              group name first. It is the identifier of the ring group and used
              every related field. Then you need to choose the strategy of
              ringing the extensions. "Hunt" is preferred as it is to ring the
              extensions one by one. You can also set the ring duration. In the
              extension list, you can enter the device id which is included in
              the group. One device for every line and the id must be ended with
              "#".

            </dl>
            <p>
              Another thing to be taken care of is the "Destination if no
              answer". You can terminate the call, pick up an extension, ask for
              leaving a message, or redirect to another ring group.

              How to create IVR

            <p>
              IVR stands for Interactive Voice Response. We can use this to
              guide the caller to different groups or extensions. First you need
              to choose the announcement (the audio file) to play in this IVR,
              then create the options.
            </p>

            </dl>
            <p>
              The above is a standard configuration of IVR options. Here you set
              the destination of an option and the button for users to press.
              Strongly recommend to have an option with its "Return to IVR"
              checked, so that the users can go back to previous menu if he
              press the wrong button.

              How to create FollowMe for user/extension
            </h2>
            <p>
              A FollowMe redirects the unanswered call to other destinations,
              like your mobile phone, another extension or home. In the FollowMe
              page, before you create a FollowMe rule, you need to choose the
              extension it belongs to. After that, you can add the destination
              phone number or extension number in the Follow-Me list.
            </p>

            </dl>
            <p>
              Be care of the phone number you add. It should follow the rules in
              outbound routes. In the sample above, the rule requires adding 9
              before the number when you make an external call, so you have to
              add 9 in front of it. For external numbers, ending with "#" is a
              must. Another thing you need look out for is the "Destination if
              no answer". If you apply voicemail to a extension, in the case
              above, 627, and you choose "Terminate Call" in this page, you will
              hear no instructions of leaving voice message. That means, the
              priority of "Destination if no answer" in FollowMe is high than
              the one in "Users".
