            Since .NET and Web Services became available, we wanted to revisit
            our problem of registering software that people download from our
            website. The New Registration DLL uses this technology to
            incorporate our database with client registrations and trials while
            making it fail safe and easy to debug.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Temp key can only extend user's evaluation period once, therefore
              we cannot issue another temp key for the same user after the
              initial one, which is not good.
            </p>
            <p>
              From version 3.13, you can use web service and Time PRO client
              diary to extend user's evaluation period for multiple times. In
              order to use this function, user need to have an entry in Client
              table (normally when user download the software, a new entry will
              be created).
            </p>
            <p>
              To do this, you need to find the client record in Time PRO and
              click on "Dairy" button on the top:
              <br />
              <img
                alt="Dairy"

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              then, add new diary record and choose the category "Registration
              Trial Can Be Extended" :
              <br />
              <img

                width="499"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              On the client side, they need to use "existing client" option
              <br />
              <img
                alt="Existing client option"
                border="0"
                src="/archive/registration/images/rego-2.png"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, the client need to type in his email address and password:
              <br />
              <img
                alt="Enter email"
                border="0"
                src="/archive/registration/images/rego-4.png"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              The registration will check SSWData2000 database through
              Registration Web Services, because we have already add the diary
              record to enable extension for this user, his product trail will
              be extended.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the user extends evaluation, the record in client's diary
              will be replaced with another record, saying "Registration Trial
              Extended (WWW)", then we know his evaluation extension has been
              done.
              <br />
              <img
                alt="Trail Extended"

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              For multiple extensions, you just need to add another
              "Registration Trial Can Be Extended" record in the client's diary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: After the client extend his evaluation for the 1st time, a
              temp key will be added into his local registry and any temp key
              will return a "Invalid key" error message.

              We give them 6 months of free upgrades. This is judged by the
              'DateCreated' of the invoice for the product. You can extend this
              for a client by altering this field. After this period and the
              user tried to upgrade or install a newer version that they had
              previously installed before this timeout period then they will be
              denied. The user has the option to continue and purchase a
              'maintenance' product with will allow the user to have another 12
              months of upgrades.

              This functionality was introduced so we can monitor and try to
              control warez keys floating around the Internet.
              <br />
              We are allowing the client to register the product as many times
              as they have licenses for with an additional 2 times every month.
              <br />
              So if I have 2 licenses i can register it 4 times per month.
              <br />
              Every purchase counts for 1 license except if it is a enterprise
              product then the purchase will account for 100 licenses.
              <br />
              Every time a client updates the application, or registers a new
              application on a new machine, a new entry is made in the
              ClientDiary table.

              Buy source code.

              2) I don't have the original image that I had when I purchased the
              software. Now I cannot register the latest version!
              <br />
              <b> Problem: </b>
              If you try to register a product after 12 months after the date of
              purchase then you will be denied and prompted to purchase a
              upgrade. We don't keep previous versions of our product so we
              cannot supply you with a working version. You should have kept the
              download.
              <br />
              <b> Solution:: </b>
              If they complain then go to their tags in TimePro! and add a
              'PRDUPD' tag with the current version of the product. This will
              allow the user to register the current version and you have now
              given them warning regarding keeping the download.

              How do I give away free versions for Journalists?

            <p>
              All you have to do is make a dummy invoice for the person for that
              product and they will be able to register the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to give them 3 months of upgrades then all you have to
              do is change the DateCreated of the invoice for the product to a
              date 9 months prior to the current date. (The rego dll gives them
              12 months of upgrades. So by changing the DateCreated to a earlier
              date their upgrade period is reduced).

              At times we give away free copies of our software as part of a
              magazine promotion or some other promotion. When this happens we
              supply eligible persons with a code. More information about our

              What happens when our products are bought through Resellers?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Each product registration is attached to a client ID. This means,
              the reseller who bought the product, has the product and its
              invoice attached to their client ID. To correct this and hand over
              the registration to the 'real' purchaser, you need to alter
              invoices. Once the invoice is paid:
            </p>
            <p>
              Step 1: Set the date back one year so they cannot activate the
              software themselves. Put in the notes field that they are a
              reseller, the invoice was changed to avoid them being able to
              activate the software themselves and getting a free copy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Step 2: Ensusre you have full details of the company that will be
              the registering company (not the reseller). If they have not
              registered with SSW yet, create a Client ID and fill in the
              details. Make sure you know which person is going to be
              registering the software and make them the main contact with their
              email address.
            </p>
            <p>
              Step 3: Create the registering company an invoice for the product
              that the reseller purchased for them and set it to zero ($0)
            </p>
            <p>
              Step 4: To register, the company will need to know the email the
              product is now bought under, as well as the password that was
              generated to unlock the registration keys. Provide this
              information over the phone if possible to avoid sendoing sensitive
              information via email. If this is unavoidable, send the email and
              password to the one main contact who will be the one registering
              the software.
