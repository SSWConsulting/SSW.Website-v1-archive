        <p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
        <p>Superior Software for Windows</p>
        <p>
          It gives me pleasure to provide the following testimonial regarding
          SSW and in particular Adam Cogan with whom I had the majority of my
          dealings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Academy Tiles is a leading ceramic tile business, importing ceramics,
          marble and glass. We wholesale and also provide a unique architectural
          library of over 5000 samples for use by professional people. Our
          showroom and warehouse are located separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          About 1995 we determined that our Dos based computer system was
          antiquated and would not allow us to survive and prosper. Our
          information needs were very comprehensive and growing. And so the
          search began. Academy Tiles commenced an Access database development
          with another developer. After some considerable work was done, I
          became dissatisfied with the work and approached Microsoft for a
          recommended Access developer to assist me in completing the exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so we were introduced to Adam Cogan and SSW. At this point we had
          a client and job database. We still required invoicing, purchasing,
          inventory and shipping.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not enjoy the first day's experience. Adam pulled no punches and
          was critical of the quality of the database structure and work to
          date. And he proposed to pull it apart and rebuild. I wasn't initially
          sold on the idea but after several days I could see a picture emerging
          of : structure, preciseness, integrity and efficiency. It was the
          system we had to have, regardless of initial cost and we have not
          looked back. Quite frankly without Adam's involvement we would have a
          clumsy inefficient system which was not easily modifiable I spent many
          days working with him developing our system and learning how to use
          Access. As a "partially" technical accountant I learnt sufficiently
          enough to be able to readily modify and evolve our system. I have also
          dealt with others at SSW like Ibrahim Qutish and Ross Donald and they
          continue to support me with any code which is beyond me. In addition
          the free generic updates from SSW are a real bonus. The generic
          functions have extended my capabilities and minimised the amount of
          code required.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an accountant I am very pleased to have the flexibility of periods
          that don't roll over. It allows us to adjust any incorrect invoices
          and re-issue with the need to create credit notes. This keeps the
          paperwork down to a minimum, reducing the confusion of an long paper
          trail. Queries are regularly rerun, accumulating monthly sales
          statistics etc. These also reflect any prior period adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
          We stock take as many times as we wish, currently six monthly and roll
          stock into an opening balance. Because of this one precaution we build
          into prior "period" transaction alterations is to prevent these
          changes if they are dated prior to the last stock take. The system is
          very flexible and can be run to suit any particular set of
          requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also very user friendly and all our staff including management
          input their own work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our business could never have achieved the level of volume and success
          it has without our Access database.
        </p>
        <p>
          And our Access database would not be what is without the involvement
          of Adam and his friendly professional and innovative team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without qualification I can state that their design work, desire to
          share and willingness to educate have made a substantial contribution
          to our business.
