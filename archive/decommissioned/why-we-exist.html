          </li>
          <p>
            People often ask our staff 'why do you work for SSW rather than
            doing consulting work as an individual?' Certainly each of us should
            be good enough to make $1000/day w more as an individual consultant.
            The reason we have banded together so that we can take on the larger
            and more technical jobs that require more resources and skills! As
            dedicated developers who love coding, this is a mroe satisfactory
            arrangement. Also, as a group we are able to provide better support,
            and add-ons like hosting if needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Software is complicated today and the best solutions come out of
            teams (the once common scenario of a single developer working with
            Access has gone...) We work in pairs according to the
            <a href="/ssw/Methodology/XPDM.aspx">
              eXtreme Programming Methodology
            </a>
            , which we believe has contributed a large amount to our success.
            This pair programming means that developers can cover for each other
            in cases where one may be on leave and support is needed. Customers
            need to feel that they won't be left on their own if something goes
            wrong, and that's one of SSW's strong points. We share knowledge, we
            support each other with complementary expertise and we don't have
            much tolerance for downtime or failure.

          <p>
            It is our belief that the first principle of good business is that
            you do not lie to customers. If a service goes down because of
            something we did wrong and should have known not to do, we tell the
            customer exactly what we did wrong in as clear language as possible.
            Even if the customer might not know that this was a stupid thing to
            do under Unix or Oracle, we explicitly tell them "this was a stupid
            thing to do." If we slacked off and partied all weekend and didn't
            finish some work that we promised, we admit it rather than conjuring
            up mythical technical dragons to slay. We do not take advantage of
            customer ignorance to hide our mistakes, a practice that is
            depressingly widespread in our industry.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don't overwhelm customer with technical jargon - explain status to
              the customer in real terms - "constant communication doesn't solve
              problems"
            </li>
            <li>involve the customer in all steps</li>
            <li>Never be vague in requirements or contracts</li>
            <li>
              "To-do" lists need to be specific - never say "we will fix all

            The goal of each each member of SSW is eventually expected to become
            an internationally famous Web developer capable of managing an
            entire project from start to finish. That doesn't mean that each
            person needs to acquire all the skills necessary for a site, but he
            or she has to understand what skills are necessary and where to get
            them within SSW.

            We live or die by customer satisfaction. It is safe to assume that
            the customers' priorities are (1) getting down services back up, and
            (2) getting new services developed on time.
