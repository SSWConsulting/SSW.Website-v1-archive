          In ages gone by your Windows Server network wasn't such an important
          item in the SME setup. You only had to worry about storing a few files
          and mdb's, and manage one or two 56 kbps connections to the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it's highly likely that Windows Server administration is
          absolutely crucial to the daily running of your business. Through
          Windows Server you manage remote workers, Web Services connections to
          other businesses, your own website using IIS and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a series of rules that help Windows Server 2003 Administrators
          ensure they are making the most of the functionality it provides. Do
          you agree with them all? Are we missing some?

            <p>
              Notebooks roam these days, and you have to ensure that the data is
              being backed up. The way we do it is either:
            </p>
            <p>
              a) keep all your files on the server and use Windows Offline Files
              <br />
              <!--SSW Code Auditor - Ignore next line(HTML)-->
              - from a server perspective we force a synchronize on logon via
              group policy
              <br />
              - from a client perspective they can run extra sync via
              "Synchronize"
              <br />
              b) keep all your files on the notebook and use a program to copy
              to the server daily
              <br />
              <!--SSW Code Auditor - Ignore next line(HTML)-->
              - from a server perspective we force a synchronize on logon via
              group policy
              <br />
              - from a client perspective they can run extra sync via "Scheduled
              Tasks"
            </p>
            <p>
              We go option b) because have had funny experiences with Office
              Files
              <br />
              <br />
              Each user has a few standard directories for keeping data that
              needs to be backed up. A simple batch file is used to copy the
              contents of these folders to a network location. The batch file
              uses Robocopy, a utility developed by Microsoft for efficiently
              copying and synchronising large numbers of files.
            </p>
            <p>Here is a screenshot of a sample batch file:</p>
            <dl class="image">

            </dl>
            <p>
              This batch file refers to a central shared file called
              Robocopy.bat, shown here:

              </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              The user's batch file is executed each day through Scheduled
              Tasks:
            </p>
            <dl class="image">
              <dt>

                />
              </dt>

            </dl>
            <p>
              After the transfer is completed, the user sees a summary of the
              files copied and any errors that occurred. A detailed report is
              also logged to the network backup location where administrators
              can check it.

              Backups can be done lots of ways. Servers are the first thing
              people look at, and the way we recommend is to have a backup
              server. Disk space is cheap so tape drives are out.
              <br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                Have the Exchange backup to a file on the server (on a rolling 5
                day plan + rolling 2 monthly plan)
              </li>
              <li>
                Have the SQL Server backup to a file on the server (on a rolling
                5 day plan + rolling 2 monthly plan)
              </li>
              <li>
                Have the File Server backup to a file on the server (on a
                rolling 5 day plan + rolling 2 monthly plan)
              </li>
              <li>
                Have the Web Server backup to a file on the server (on a rolling
                5 day plan + rolling 2 monthly plan)
              </li>
              <li>
                Have the SharePoint backup to a file on the server (on a rolling

            <p>
              Using SQL Server 2000 Enterprise, the DBA can back up and restore
              databases and T log files. The DBA can schedule backups to occur
              at off hours, direct backups on remote disks to occur across the
              network, and configure the monitoring agent to send email and page
              alerts if the backups are unsuccessful. More could be found at

              Do your servers have fixed IP address?
            </h2>
            <p>
              IP address management is important in any network. Generally a
              DHCP server will find its way into most networks, unless you
              specify your servers IP address they will get a random IP from the
              DHCP server. Letting your servers get a random IP is a bad idea as
              IP's are usually referred directly to servers in network config,
              firewall settings, port redirection, and generally annoying as you
              cannot remember the IP.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a small network, we reserve a small band of IP's for
              servers/printers like 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.20

            <p>
              Network monitoring and review is an important part of a network
              administrators job especially if external bandwidth is used. You
              should know how much bandwidth your VPN clients and other VPN
              offices are using. You should also be able to easily investigate
              what traffic can be minimised.
            </p>
            <p>
              By assigning an IP range within your Routing and Remote Access
              server, you are able to filter logs based on these IP addresses
              and distinguish unnecessary traffic.
            </p>

              To set this up go Start -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Routing
              and Remote Access. Right click the server and go Properties. Click
              the IP tab and select "Static address pool". Click the Add button

                worm has ripped through the world with blistering speed
                infecting countless computers using Microsoft operating systems.
                Microsoft are now licking their wounds and many users are in
                damage control. Network administrators who have not been
                diligent with their updates and patches are now being asked to
                explain themselves. How do you fix it? The simple solution is
                <b> Automatic Updates </b>
                , the better solution is
                <b> Software Update Services </b>
                . Whilst enabling automatic updates on your windows settings
                seems like a quick and easy fix, and it could improve our
                network, there are some things that you need to know about this:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Regardless of when you download the update, it needs to be
                  installed to avoid all risks of getting STUNG.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you do have it set to automatically update, and you need
                  then you'll be paying through the nose in download usage every
                  month for patches on every machine on your network.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                If you're going to use this method you can get to the automatic
                updates options by going to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; System
                &gt; Automatic Updates.

                The avoid the problems associated with enabling automatic
                updates on your computer we think that the best solution to this
                problem for middle to large organizations is to use Microsoft
                Software Update Services. This nifty little download allows you
                to download patches ONCE and then, when approved, get every
                client machine patched from the one location.

              Have you configured your RAID notification software?
            </h2>
            <p>
              We all know that hardware RAID is faster, more stable, easier to
              recover from a disaster, etc than software RAID.
              <br />
              The only problem is that with cheap RAID cards or onboard RAID
              there is not enough information about your hardware and what its
              doing without having to reboot the computer and enter the RAID
              configuration.
              <br />
              More expensive RAID cards have software that comes with it that
              enables you to configure your hardware within windows.

              The advantage of this software is that it generally comes with
              some monitoring service that can notify you if there a hardware
              problem or fault. It is very important that you get a RAID card
              that has this ability. This way you will always know that your
              servers are ok unless you get notified.
