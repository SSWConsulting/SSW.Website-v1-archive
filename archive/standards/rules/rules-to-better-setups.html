       <p>
        Ideally the setup.exe should not be complicated. Its only
                purpose is to allow the user to install the required software so
                that it can be run or tested.
        <br>
        Simple meaningful screens for every dialog of the installation
                will help the user only click "Next, Next, Next" until the
                application has been installed correctly.

        Do you avoid deploying a separate application for users to check

       </h2>
       <p>
        We used to include the built-in Wise Update in our applications
                for users to check and update to the latest version easily.
                However the problem is that users dont check for updates
                manually.

         <img alt="Wise Update merge module" src="/archive/standards/rules/images/wise-update-merge-module.gif">
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Figure: Wise installer provides a version checker as a merge
                  module for easy integration.

         <img alt="Check for updates manually" src="/archive/standards/rules/images/wise-check-for-update.gif">
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Figure: A separate application to check for update, how often
                  will you check for update manually? (Bad)
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p>
        Wise updater will never work because the WiseUpdt.exe is being
                called from the application - so it can't fully uninstall itself
                when it is open - so it asks for a reboot.
       </p>
       <p>
        <br>
        The better way to check for updates is to do it automatically
                whenever the application launches. We implement a version
                checker on the first wizard screen or applications main screen,
                this way the users will know that we have a newer version
                available.
        <br>
        E.g.:
       </p>
       <dl class="goodImage">
        <dt>
         <img alt="Check for updates automatically" src="/archive/standards/rules/images/bad-ui.gif">
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Figure: Users know that a new version is available, and they
                  can click the link to download new version. (Good)

        Do you build a new version every day there are changes (a.k.a.
                Continuous Integration)?
       </h2>
       <p>
        Each time changes have been made to an application, a new
                version should be built at the end of the day (as a minimum).
                This enables testers to test the latest version, and gives
                clients the ability to check progress made on their application.
       </p>
       <p>
        The easiest way to achieve this is to have a continuous
                integration server (we use Team Foundation Build Server). The
                continuous integration server automates a build and unit test
                run for an application and reports on success/failure of the
                build and tests.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the end of a successful auotmated build process the install
                files produced are available for testers and clients to use.
       </p>
       <p>
        This process can be automated to run at specific times during
                the day and/or after each check in to source control.

       </h2>
       <p>
        A version number is only good if it conveys useful information.
                We use a 4 part version number which is made up of the
                following:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>

         Build / Changeset number

         The Major version number should only be changed at the
                  discretion of the product owner. This is usually due to
                  addition of completely new areas of functionality for the
                  application.

        Do you make a setup.exe before development?
       </h2>
       <p>
        The setup.exe should be in the first release. Many developers
                leave it to the end and all sorts of problems start happening
                when we realize that it would be better if the application
                creates the virtual directory, rather than the setup.exe Nothing
                good can happen when you leave the setup.exe to the end.

       <p>
        Making a setup.exe should be simple. As I have do to it every
                day I want to make it as painless as possible. If it takes too
                long to package up your software, you're going to run into

        Regardless of the size of the project, if there are many steps
                involved in creating a build, then chances are you will run into
                problems.
        <br>
        My recommendation is to aim for a
        <b>
         one-step
        </b>
        build. A single program (or script) that gets all the latest
                required files, adds a version number, compiles them, generates
                a setup executable and places it on the correct media - CD ROM,
                FTP Site, etc.

        Do you always update the version number whenever a new build is

       </h2>
       <p>
        By using a
        <a href="#MeaningfulVersionNumber">
         meaningful
        </a>
        version number we can easily identify exactly which version of
                an application someone is using. If the version number is not
                changed for each build, we can never be sure which version of an
                application is being used or what source was used to compile it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The best way to ensure the build number is always updated is to
                update it during the build process. We use Team Foundation
                Server's changeset number instead of an incrementing build
                number. This can be achieved by using
        <a href="/SSW/Redirect/Tigris.htm">
         MSBuild Community Tasks
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        By using the changeset number as the build number this means
                anyone can go into source control and retrieve the exact source
                used to build a particular version of an application. By
                definition this number is always increasing (it increments any
                time someone commits a change to the repository). It also means
                we're implicitly 'tagging' each build. If explicit tags aren't
                set on the repository for a build/release in other versioning
                conventions it can be very difficult to identify which version
                of the source was used to produce that build/release.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is very common for an application to still require minor
                fixes before the approval to release it. Developers tend to
                ignore incrementing the version number for the product even when
                making a minor change, and do not consider it to be important
                (perhaps hoping that no one has yet installed the version that
                has been packaged).
       </p>
       <p>
        However if the version number has not been increased then the
                installation package will not prompt the user to upgrade it,
                rather it will ask the user to repair the product which gives
                the impression that there has been no updates.

        Do you put the minimal amount of intelligence in the setup.exe?
       </h2>
       <p>
        The setup.exe should really just do an xcopy. Avoid putting any
                intelligence (like creating databases or virtual directories)
                into the Wise/InstallShield Setup. It is much cheaper and better
                to put this logic into the actual app.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an example sees the three choices you have for creating a
                database - see the KB about

       <p>
        Exceptions do exist. We do put intelligence into the setup.exe
                if we need a clean uninstall. Examples where we put intelligence

        Do you know that the installer should only install files to the

       </h2>
       <p>
        For your applications the user settings should not stored in
                C:\Program Files - if you do you can be assured that they wont
                work in Vista!
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead you need to store the user's settings in the application
                data folder. A common mistake is that the installer is used to
                copy the installer to copy the settings files to the application
                data folder.

        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p>
        Therefore the installer should only copy files to the
                installation folder (eg: C:\Program Files\SSW Code Auditor),
                because if the settings files are copied to the application data
                folder by the installer, they will get removed on
                un-installation. This is bad as they contain the user's
                settings.
        <br>
        <br>
        The better way of doing this is keeping the default settings
                file in the installation folder, and when the application starts
                up, if no settings file is found in the user's application data
                folder, then copy the default settings file into the application
                data folder.

        Do you skip setup installers for web project packages ?
       </h2>
       <p>
        If you want lots of people to use your Windows App, then you
                always need an installer. Does the same rule apply for Web apps?
       </p>
       <p>
        Web applications generally only need to be setup in three
                locations. That is, the development machine, the test server,
                and the web (production) server. Therefore there is no need to
                make a setup package for these projects as they will never need
                to be installed on a mass scale which means that it's not worth
                the money to attempt to have a more complicated setup package.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Option 1:
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        If you have access then simply use FTP to transfer synchronise
                files between servers
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Option 2:

       </p>
       <p>
        For most of our web projects we will commonly just use a zip
                file for distributing the project for someone else to install at
                a remote location. This zip file includes:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The layout files (.aspx)
        </li>
        <li>
         The resource files (.jpg, .css, .js, etc)
        </li>
        <li>
         The bin directory with the .dll files
        </li>
        <li>
         a _Instructions.doc with screen captures and detailed
                  documentation on how to configure the file system, IIS, and
                  directory security.
         <br>
         This way our network administrators can be kept happy by
                  having full control over where in the file-system the websites
                  live (which might be important for the backup strategy) and
                  allow us to make full use of webserver features within our
                  application.

         Need more reasons:
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The reasons we do not make an .exe or .msi for a web project are
                many. As detailed above it mainly development the development
                cost that only a couple of people will use. There are other
                difficulties developing .exe's and .msi's like:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         creating virtual directories. Wise will only allow you to
                  install to the Default Website
        </li>
        <li>
         configuring the directory and IIS security options, for
                  example granting the local ASPNET user account access to your
                  physical directory
        </li>
        <li>
         handling important settings in the web.config file (remember
                  the normal implementation of a website has this read-only)
        </li>
        <li>
         support of other web server platforms (other than IIS)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Note: There is one obvious exception to the rule, and that is
                when you need to create a sample web project as part of some
                other application. For example, a website would be included in
                your .msi when installing a web control component with samples.

        </a>
        Do you have an "Installation Prerequisites" screen during
                installation?
       </h2>
       <p>
        There is no point to allow the user to install your software and
                find out they cannot use it. Therefore, the setup.exe should
                always have an "Installation Prerequisites" screen in your
                installation, after the first welcome screen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, you should detect if your user's computer meets all
                these requirements and give them the link to download the
                required software if possible.
       </p>

       </dl>
       <p>
        Sometime, it's not possible to detect the required software
                during the installation. An example would be if you require your
                users to have SQL Server installed, but this can be on a
                networked computer. If you have this case then your setup.exe
                should have an "Other Requirements" form in your installation.

                  Reporting Services can be installed on a networked machine, so
                  the user is only given the information and the application
                  will worry about checking and setting up this.

       <p>
        Warning: Too many times the 'Continue Anyway' approach is not
                taken, and the developers add validation but with no flexibility
                to continue. An example of this can be found in an installation
                package that requires a user to have a certain version of SQL
                Server, or SQL Server Reporting Services, or Exchange Server, or
                .NET Framework on his computer. The disabled button stops the
                user just clicking "Next" without noticing the problem and the
                checkbox gives the user to ignore it when they know it is OK,
                for example if a newer version of the .NET Frameword is released
                that supports .NET 2.0 apps but the registry key that the
                setup.exe is looking for has changed.

        Do you include version numbers in your setup filename?
       </h2>
       <p>
        I'm always downloading my favourite 3rd party software utilities
                from the web. But I find it very frustrating if the developer
                has not made it easy to check whether I've already got the
                latest version. It is not OK to expect a user to run the
                setup.exe in order to find out what version it is.
       </p>
       <p>
        The easy solution is to include the version number in the name
                of the setup file. We use [productname]_ver[major
                version]-[minor version].exe E.g. SSWCodeAuditor_Ver1-89.exe
       </p>
       <p>
        In .NET, however, you strike a problem. .NET removes any 0 in
                the prefix and so e.g. _v1-02 becomes _v1-2.&nbsp; The rather
                contrived solution is to start minor versions at 11. Therefore
                _v1-11.exe is your first version.
       </p>
       <p>
        To deal with those naughty developers who don't include version
                numbers, rename the file after you download it...
