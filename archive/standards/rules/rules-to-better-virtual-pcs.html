     Microsoft Virtual PC provides facilities to run a complete operating
          system and hard drive images on top of a host operating system. This
          is a boon for testing in multiple environments and for hosting
          providers.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, to run Virtual PC in a most efficient way, we have developed
          a few rules for a better Virtual PC usage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do you agree with them all? Are we missing some?

      By default, Virtual PC will not offer you the chance to undo your
            changes. When testing applications, you do not want to taint your
            test environment with DLLs you have previously installed. You should
            be testing on a clean install of the operating system and core
            programs (e.g. Office if required, .NET Framework 1.1) - so that
            your test environment is the same as the standard user environment.
            To allow your test Virtual PC image to be rolled back to the state
            before you installed your test software, you should check on the
            "Enable Undo Disks" option when creating your Virtual PC image.
            However in some cases, such as keeping undo disks that haven't been
            committed to the virtual hard disk can create a large amount of
            disk-related overhead. Therefore it is recommended that developers
            store the undo disks on a separate physical disk to the virtual hard
            disk.

     </li>
     <p>
      Virtual PC can be a resource hog on any machine. For maximum
            performance in your Virtual PC image, you should set the maximum
            memory size greater than the default (the default is typically
            128MB). If it is the only virtual PC you are running on the machine,
            we recommend you set the memory footprint to 2/3rds of the physical
            memory on your machine. You should also shut down all non-essential
            services, end any nonessential tasks and close any large
            applications (esp Outlook). Otherwise, your Virtual PC image will be
            embarrassingly slow when doing that demo to your customers!

     </li>
     <p>
      Betas are perfect candidates for running on Virtual PCs, as their
            fundamental function is to provide a baseline application that can
            be tested for bugs and possible improvements. Betas can also be
            unpredictable and can cause instability if they encounter a problem.
            Virtual PCs can be utilized for this scenario, as they offer a
            secure and protected environment for carrying out testing on betas
            without affecting the host machine.

      </h2>
     </li>
     <p>
      By storing the virtual hard disk on a separate physical disk or
            hardware that offers better performance and fast access, you can
            significantly improve the performance of the Virtual PC, as it will
            utilize the resources of the physical disk while freeing up
            resources for the host operating system. For optimum performance,
            SCSI hard disks, redundant array of independent disks (RAID) or a
            SAN should be used to store the virtual hard disks.

       Do you protect your virtual environment?
      </h2>
     </li>
     <p>
      The virtual environment mirrors any physical operating system and is
            therefore vulnerable to the same viruses and malware that affects
            any other operating system. Hence it is necessary to protect the
            Virtual PC environment in the same fashion as the host operating
            system. This means installing anti-virus protection on each virtual
            machine, enabling a firewall to block unwanted incoming and outgoing
            traffic and installing the latest security patches and updates to
            ensure that the virtual machine is protected against the latest
            security threats.

       Do you backup your virtual machine?
      </h2>
     </li>
     <p>
      The virtual machine acts like any data storage device and the
            associated virtual machine files should be backed up to save all of
            the data and configuration settings of that particular virtual
            machine. The easiest method for backing up the virtual machine is to
            simply backup the virtual hard disk onto a secondary storage device.
            The process of restoring the image is just as simple.

       Do you follow the correct shut down procedure?
      </h2>
     </li>
     <p>
      Before shutting down the host operating system, it is vital that the
            virtual machine be shut down first. This is to ensure that no data
            has been lost. Similarly when suspending the host operating system,
            the virtual machine must be suspended first to avoid data loss.

       Do you install virtual machine additions?

     </li>
     <p>
      Virtual Machine Additions are a set of features that improve the
            integration of the host and guest operating systems. It also
            improves the performance and manageability of the guest operating
            system. Some of the special features included are mouse pointer
            integration, time synchronization and overall improvement in the
            performance of the guest operating system.

      Install the virtual machine additions by following these steps:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Start the Virtual machine by selecting the appropriate virtual
              machine in the virtual machine console and clicking "Start".

              performance. This includes both the physical drive on which the
              Virtual hard drive is located as well as the virtual drives within
              the Virtual PC. By doing this you can experience a significant
              improvement in the speed of the Virtual PC. The built-in Windows
              defragging tool or any other 3rd party tool can be utilized.

       Do you exclude your virtual machine from anti-virus scans?
      </h2>
      <p>
       You should exclude your virtual machine files from being scanned
              by your host anti-virus software. This includes files such as
              .vmc, .vhd and .vud. Scanning these files slows down the host
              operating and is unnecessary as the anti-virus software installed
              in your Virtual PC performs the same task.

       Do you use an operational base when creating multiple VPC images?
      </h2>
      <p>
       When you consider creating multiple VPC images for different
              versions of Visual Studio, Office or other kind of software (Betas
              or CTP versions), create first a fully operational base with just
              the OS. On top of this OS install additional software to
              differencing disks eliminating Side x Side problems. That makes
              installation of additional VPC images faster, because you don't
              start completely from scratch each time. And you save disk space
              by using an OS base for all images.
