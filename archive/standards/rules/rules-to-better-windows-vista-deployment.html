            At SSW we buy new computers as we need them – developers choose what
            they like e.g. Dell, HP, IBM or even the MacBook Pro with the dual
            boot that makes the designers happy!
            <br />
            <br />
            Choice is good, however it does have its drawbacks; particularly
            when it comes to operating system deployments. In the past, each
            developer has had to build their environment each time they get a
            new PC or format from scratch because most deployment systems (such
            as Norton Ghost) are hardware specific.
            <span lang="en-au"> </span>
            Depending on how much software a developer need to install, the time
            would range from a few hours to a couple of days.
            <br />
            With the latest set of administration tools deployed with Microsoft
            Vista we finally have a nice solution to deploying our operating
            environments.

            Since the release of Vista to Microsoft’s Business Partners, SSW has
            successfully deployed Vista to 90% of our developer machines. We
            chose to implement Microsoft’s new Business Desktop Deployment (BDD)
            solution and boy it deploys Vista images quickly. The images include
            not just the OS, but all our standard applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, unattended deployment time takes on average 45 mins.
            This includes the format! We were impressed and this
            <strong> *one feature* </strong>
            has saved us significant time and money.
            <br />
            We’ve learnt a lot in the process, and I’m sure you’ll find the new
            Rules to Better Windows Vista Deployment valuable. These rules aim
            to help you prepare your deployment of Microsoft Windows Vista
            across your small to medium sized organization.
          </p>
          Note: Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you need Vista to get
          Office 2007. Several of our clients don't have machines that support
          Vista. We've gone ahead and installed Office 2007 directly on XP and
          they love it.

              Windows Vista is much more resource dependant (about 25% slower)
              than Windows XP. Therefore it is essential for PCs, which are
              being upgraded to Windows Vista, to meet the minimum recommended
              specifications. There is the

                Efficient way to check if you can do a RAM upgrade
              </h2>
              <p>
                Although the minimum operating requirements of Vista state 512MB
                of memory, we would suggest for practical reasons that you will
                need at least 1.5 GB of RAM - although 2 GB is ideal.
              </p>
              <p>
                An easy way to check the maximum RAM you can upgrade to and the
                number of slots you have is by using

                </a>
                . On some older machines, the motherboard specifications may be
                the limiting factor. It is sometimes common for an older
                notebook to support up to 2GB of memory.

              <p>
                If you're not sure what type of RAM your notebook needs, use an
                online memory finder.

              <p>
                When you're installing a new OS on your PC it's always a dilemma
                as to whether to go the whole hog and reformat your hard drive
                or take the upgrade path into the new system. Upgrading is nice
                because there is no need to install all your programs again. The
                problem is all the old junk stays around.
              </p>
              <p>
                At SSW always go for a fresh start. We've already found a number
                of programs (including Visual Studio 2003) will not work in
                Vista. Besides, a nice, clean C: drive to go with your new,
                nice, clean operating system is always a big plus. Just be sure
                to follow your organization's backup standards carefully!

              <p>
                Note: For individuals looking to upgrade to Windows Vista, the
                upgrade process is exactly the same as that for Windows XP.

              <p>
                With Windows XP we commonly see situations where a system
                rebuild takes a day or more. With Windows Vista we have got that
                down to 45 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Windows Vista has deployment tools which you can download, which
                make it significantly easier for organizations ranging from
                small to large sizes to migrate to Windows Vista.
              </p>

                At SSW, we use option 3, which means that you need the new
                deployment tool which utilizes Image Based Setups (IBS). When
                you use IBS you install all the programs you you create a large
                .WIM file. Once the custom image is created you deployed
                individually to each PC as detailed below:
              </p>
              <p>
                Note, for option 4, you use the same IBS method described for
                creation of your image. Windows Deployment Services is the
                equivalent of Remote Installation Services on Windows Server
                2003. For this deployment process, a dedicated server is
                required.

              <p>In order to use IBS you will need to:</p>

                Developers are going to have to get used to running in a VPC -
                and Vista will force you to get used to it - in that respect it
                may be a blessing in disguise. To ensure a smooth migration
                process, your image should include a shortcut on the desktop to
                a Virtual PC so you can continue with all of these incompatible

              <p>
                Visual Studio .NET 2003 is incompatible in Windows Vista. This
                poses a significant problem for developers looking to maintain
                their .NET 1.1 applications. A simple solution is to create a
                Virtual PC using Virtual PC 2007 of all the necessary
                development tools on the Windows XP platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                To debug your applications in Windows Vista, you can use Remote
                Debugging where the application is running on the Vista machine,
                but it being debugged by the Virtual PC. Please see the
                whitepaper "Taking Advantage of Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 for
                Developing and Maintaining .NET 1.1 and 2.0 Applications in

                It will be much easier for user to know the version of the
                Windows Vista Image installed in their machines if you put the
                versioning information in a text file, for example:
                <b> C:\_VistaImageVersion.txt. </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                NOTE: When you build the image you need to update
                C:\_VistaImageVersion.txt.

                It is a waste of time and resources to have Windows Vista
