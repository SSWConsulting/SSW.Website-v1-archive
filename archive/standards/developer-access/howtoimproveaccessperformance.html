     How to Improve Access Performance
    </h2>
    <p>
     Compact your database often to reclaim space
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="Compact the database" height="403" src="/archive/standards/developer-access/images/image-11.gif" width="508">
    </p>
    <p>
     Compacting your database reclaims unused space and makes almost all
          operations faster. You will do this on a regular basis. When you
          compact the database, you reorganize records so that they are stored
          in adjacent spaces, making retrieval faster. Additionally, compacting
          a database updates its data statistics, which can be used by a query
          to run faster. Defragmenting first is just academic.... You may want
          to defragment your disk using a program such as the Disk Defragmenter
          that ships with Windows 95 before compacting your database. This
          leaves contiguous free disk space immediately after the database file.
          In theory, this make future additions to the database occur faster.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      You can force a query to recompile (which in turn causes it to use
            the latest statistics) by opening it in design view, saving it, and
            then running it.
     </li>
     <li>
      Also be sure to compact anytime you import or delete objects in your
            database, or compile and save VBA code.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Increase RAM
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Increase the amount of RAM on your computer. The minimum acceptable
          amount of RAM for Access 97 is 16 MB. 32 MB is better but 64 MB is
          SSW's recommendation. Windows NT requires more RAM than Windows 95 to
          achieve the same level of performance, so if you have the choice
          always get 64 MB of RAM.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Keep Enough Local Hard Disk Space Free
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Access requires a fair amount of disk space to operate, especially
          with large databases. Operations such as running large action queries,
          adding lots of data, importing data, and compiling and saving module
          code can use a lot of additional space on a temporary basis.
          Additionally, transactions and compacting the database can use a lot
          of disk space. A good rule of thumb is to have roughly 5-10 times the
          size of your largest database available in free local storage. SSW
          recommends that you should always have at least 100 MB free.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Run on a Computer with a Pentium processor
    </p>
    <p>
     Access requires a Pentium processor for adequate performance. A
          DX4/100 MHZ processor is the minimum but a Pentium200 MMX is
          recommended as the base Intel Processor.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Avoid Wallpaper
    </p>
    <p>
     Avoid wallpaper, unless you are using a small, tiled bitmap.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Close Access Occasionally to Reclaim Leaked Memory
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost all Windows applications "leak" memory. This is due to data
          structures, variables and other memory consumers that are not
          correctly released by applications. By closing Access, you allow
          Windows to reclaim this leaked memory.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Close Unneeded Applications
    </p>
    <p>
     Free up memory by closing applications that you aren't using. If you
          are using the System Agent from the Microsoft Windows Plus Pack,
          consider turning it off to make more memory available for your Access
          application.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Disable Office Startup Programs
    </p>
    <p>
     Office installs one or more startup programs in your
          Windows\Start\Menu\Programs\Startup folder. Typically, the two
          programs installed are the Office Fast Start and Office Find Fast
          indexing utilities. Consider removing these items from the Startup
          folder, as they use up memory. Additionally, the Find Fast indexer
          runs continuously, and can dramatically reduce Access application
          performance.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Don't Use Disk Compression Software
    </p>
    <p>
     Do not use disk compression software on the drive where you have
          installed Microsoft Access, or where your database file(s) are
          located. Disk compression exacts a heavy toll on performance, and this
          toll can be acute in database applications.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Don't Use RAM Disks
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't waste RAM by using a RAM disk. RAM disks are a vestige of 16-bit
          Windows and DOS systems, and have no place on modern computers.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Install Access Locally
    </p>
    <p>
     Do not install Microsoft Access, or its related Microsoft Office
          components on a network drive. Most applications, including Access and
          Office perform better when run from local drives.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Install Windows Locally
    </p>
    <p>
     The Windows operating system should be installed on a local fixed
          drive on your computer. Because of the number of components involved
          in running Windows, a network installation of Windows causes poor
          performance, especially for database applications.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Keep Databases Local
    </p>
    <p>
     Whenever possible, keep your databases local instead of on a network
          drive. In almost all cases, local disk access is faster than network
          access.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Adjust Virtual Memory Settings
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Windows 95's default virtual memory settings are adequate for
          most systems, you may want to consider lowering the settings if you
          don't have a lot of space on the disk being used for virtual memory,
          or you may wish to use another local drive that is faster than the one
          being used by default for virtual memory.
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Open Databases Exclusively
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are opening a database, and no other users need to use the
          database, open the database in exclusive mode. To do this, check the
          Exclusive checkbox in the Open Database dialog, as shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img alt="Exclusive mode" height="350" src="/archive/standards/developer-access/images/image-12.gif" width="620">
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <b>
    </b>
    <p>
     Optimise your Disk
    </p>
    <p>
     Keep your hard disk in optimal shape by deleting unneeded files and
          emptying your Recycle Bin. Use a disk defragmenter, such as the one
          found the Windows 95 Accessories, Systems tools menu.
    </p>

      Developers Only: Saving space with
      <br>
      single precision number fields
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the most prevalent design problems we see with databases is the
          unnecessary use of the Double number field. In some cases changing all
          the double precision number fields in a table from double to single
          real can trim the space used by about 40%. This makes a lot of
          difference to performance in reading the file. You can store numbers
          from -3.402823E38 to -1.401298E-45. Basically if the number is going
          to have over 6 significant figures in it, then think very carefully
          about this change as those precise number will get trimmed. An export
          of the table to a text file will allow you recover if you do trim a
          number incorrectly. Numbers such as 25.773 and -43000.1 dont need
          double precision. Dont forget to compact your database after this
          event.
