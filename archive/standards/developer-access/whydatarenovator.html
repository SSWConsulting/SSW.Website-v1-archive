          Keeping your live production database up to date with the latest
          structural changes is an ongoing problem for developers. The database
          needs to be taken offline quickly to make structural changes and
          convert data but this can be tricky when people are relying on the
          system. The data conversion can also take time as new fields and
          relationships might have been added.
        </p>
        <h2>The Common Scenario</h2>
        <p>
          At SSW the common scenario when the client requested changes to an
          existing application was that:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            While the changes are made the client continued to use the database
            system in their offices.
          </li>
          <li>
            The developers worked on the Application Database and made
            structural changes to a copy of the Data Database.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changes to the Data Database were tracked and either Update Queries
            or DAO code was written to make the update.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          After development was finished, a visit was made to the clients
          offices and the database was taken offline while changes were made
          manually to the Data database. This was time consuming and expensive
          for the client, there had to be a better way...
        </p>
        <h2>Using SSW Data Renovator</h2>
        <p>
          So we developed SSW Data Renovator. This allows us to do the
          development in a similar way but when we come to update the data at
          the clients offices we use SSW Data Renovator. We compare the version
          that the Client has been using against the version that has just come
          out of development. The changes are checked and confirmed and all
          reports are printed. The data is then transferred into a clean copy of
          the new database structure and the number of records transferred is
          checked from within the SSW Data Renovator interface. The downtime of
          the clients database system is shortened and the possibility of
          mistakes is reduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: If the client is not accessible we use
          <a href="/ssw/DataPRO"> SSW Data PRO! </a>
          Which uses a different approach in that it records changes to the data
          database and replicates at the client site i.e. perform changes to
          database structure remotely without user intervention.
        </p>
        <h2>Different Methods of Updating a Database</h2>
        <p>
          The following examples assume that the database is in Microsoft Access
          format and has the data in a separate database to the forms, reports
          and code. The client or live production database is named DBDATAv1.mdb
          and the development team has made changes to the structure of this
          database, which is now called DBDATAv2.mdb.

        <h2>Issues of Converting Live Data</h2>
        <p>
          Assuming you have ruled out the first option Database Offline for
          anything other than small changes, the following issues need to be
          considered:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b> Tracking Structural Changes </b>
          </li>
          <p>
            As development is being done on a copy of the live database that
            will be synchronized with the live database at the end of
            development, all changes to the schema must be tracked. Tracking
            changes is especially important when using methods 2, 3 and 4. SSW
            Data Renovator compares two databases and reports any differences in
            the structure
          </p>
          <li>
            <b> Making Structural Changes </b>
          </li>
          <p>
            If the old database will have its structure changed instead of
            transferring all data into the new database, structural changes need
            to be made either manually or through code. Methods 2 and 4 work
            this way. Another SSW product SSW Data PRO! can be used to
            automatically make structural changes to databases on-site
          </p>
          <li>
            <b> Removing all test data from the new structure </b>
          </li>
          <p>
            Using Methods 2 and 3, the developer makes a copy of the master data
            database that has the new structure, clears all test data out of
            this database then transfers the data from the live database into
            the development database. Clearing test data can be a painstaking
            task if the database is large and referential integrity is enforced,
            as the data must be deleted from tables in the correct order from
            the child tables upwards. SSW Data Renovator can remove all data
            from a database in the correct order according to the relationships
            defined in the database.
          </p>
          <li>
            <b> Converting the Data from the old data structure to the new </b>
          </li>
          <p>
            Once development has finished, either the production database must
            have its structure changed to match the changes made in development
            or the data must be transferred to an empty copy of the development
            database. This can be complicated when new fields have been added
            which cannot be empty, new relationships have been defined and field
            properties have been changed. SSW Data Renovator reports differences
            between tables and fields as well as indexes, relationships or
            properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making structural changes to the database works when the database is
            very large and only a small number of changes have been made,
            alternatively the data is transferred from the old version to the
            new. This ensures that none of the changes made in development are
            lost and the data is valid. SSW Data Renovator performs data
            transfer from one database to another without any changes to the old
            database. Tables and Fields can even be renamed and transferred
            without renaming the fields in the old database.
          </p>
          <li>
            <b> Checking all data has been transferred correctly </b>
          </li>
          <p>
            After the data has been transferred, checks are needed to ensure
            that all the records have been transferred correctly. Usually this
            consists of counting the records in the tables before and after the
            transfer. SSW Data Renovator automatically displays a list of tables
            and the number of records before and after the transfer.
          </p>
