                IE does a good job at restoring your windows after a crash.
                <br />
                The 'Restore previous folder windows at logon' should also work
                when Windows crashes.

                Bottom line... Design for failure.

                PS: Also you should not be turning on and off options when you
                click in the red circle area. That is selecting an option, not

                Then on the Services Properties Dialog I should be able to:
                <li>
                  See I have '531 events' for this service - add a "View History

                <li>
                  Drill through to the event log (to see the '531 events') -
                  automatically 'Create custom view'

                <li>
                  Create an alert (aka 'Display a message') - provide a shortcut

                  Suggestion – Give us a front camera on the WP7

              <p>
                Mmmm I wonder if I will get others agreeing with this request.
                <br />
                <br />
                When I first got my iPhone4 I didn't use this feature, so I
                didn't consider it a front camera important. Whether the
                WinPhone7 had it, or not, I just didn't care.
                <br />
                <br />
                But things have changed for me, and these days I am doing more
                and more recordings (mainly when I am a scrum master), so I
                don't want a Windows Phone 7 now, since they are missing it this
                thing I have grown to love.
                <br />
                (Interestingly I don't think I care about making facetime phone
                calls).
                <br />
                <br />
                So I would like to see Microsoft change the minimum specs for
                the Windows Phone 7 so they force the hardware to have a front
                camera.
                <br />
                FYI this is the current minimum specs -

                </a>
                <br />
                <br />
                And I guess for others especially the young kids, video calls
                are already important and sure to become bigger in the future…..
                bandwidth and traffic are getting cheaper and cheaper you know.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I am sad there is no front camera on the WP7 and I would love
                to know what the logic was when the team said "Let's cut the
                requirement for a front camera."
                <br />
                And I am sure there were other things that also got cut, that
                were *even* higher up the list too... I would love to know what
                those were too.
