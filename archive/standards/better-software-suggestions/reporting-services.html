     Every day there are little things that we find annoying with the programs we use.
        Sometimes we just can't quite do what we want or there may just be room for improvement.
        We could write books about it, like Annoyances.org, but we thought this would be
        more constructive. Here is what we would like Microsoft to change within SQL Server
        Reporting Services.

<p>
       We, like most of you, use letterheads and standard document templates to ensure
                that every document that leaves the company is the same. So why should this be any
                different with your reports? Reporting Services does not have this functionality,
                which causes a few big problems:
      </p>
<ol>
<li>
        You have to copy and paste your company logo into every single header of your existing
                    and new reTest data source connection
       </li>
<li>
<a href="#DescriptionName">
         The subscription needs an extra Name field
        </a>
</li>
</ol>
      Microsoft SQL Reporting Services suggests all this into every report, it is
            hard to make sure that everything is consistently aligned and sized for all reports;
            the designer is very flexible so it is easy to get this wrong.

       Browser Integration for Editing Reports
      </h2>
<p>
       Although perhaps rather difficult, when viewing a report from ReportManager I want
                    to be able to click a button (preferably like the one in IE for editing pages using
                    FrontPage) and the Report Definition File is automatically downloaded and then opened
                    in Visual Studio (providing the RS client is installed).
      </p>
<p>
       This is already possible for editing pages directly in Frontpage via a button in
                    the web browser. To see how to set this up, see our
       <a href="/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesDevelopment.aspx#MSExpressionWeb">

</dl>
<p>
       In this way all employees (with sufficient privilege) can conveniently make changes
                    to the report when needed. To see why we think users will be able to efficiently

<p>
       A possible solution would be to have the report server append a meta tag to the
                    output html source. A browser plugin would then detect the meta tag and allow editing
                    of the appropriate report.

       Query Strings
      </h2>
<p>
       When a report is viewed either directly from the ReportServer or via the ReportManager
                    the querystring for the report including the parameter values will automatically
                    be updated after the "Preview Report" button has been pressed.
      </p>
<p>
       In this way, a report with the given parameters can be easily bookmarked or passed
                    on using only the address in the address bar.

       </dd>
</dl>
<p>
       For example, since I have used non-default parameter values, the query string will
                    read:

       </span>
</p>
<p>
       This could be an option for either the report (specified at design time) or for
                    the entire report server (specified at install time / via server config files) so
                    that they can be turned on or off (for those with issues with privacy). See why

       It is true that if there are a large number of parameters the query string method
                    may not work. All software has limitations - just put a warning messagebox when

                    it should at least check that the page and system is working rather than giving a

        For example, we installed a Yukon Beta, with a Whidbey Beta, and the IIS settings

       The max and min scale properties have been partially fixed in Reporting Services

       I say partially, because you still have to manually set these values on a chart
                    and it requires a bit of a hack to do (see the above rule). Why can't a chart automatically
                    work out its maximum and minimum value based on the grouping level? There should be
                    a default value, and an option to enter an expression.

<h2>
       Add an Internet Content Control for embedding HTML
      </h2>
<p>
       Reporting Services is missing the ability to embed web pages into its reports. For
                    example, say you have some web pages that are updated regularly (e.g a project page)
                    and you want these pages to be emailed to you weekly. It would be great to take
                    advantage of the Reporting Services subscription engine, but we need to be able
                    to embed HTML pages into RS reports to get this done.
      </p>
<p>
       We think that an Internet Content Control will be introduced and it will have the
                    ability to:
      </p>
<ul>
<li>
        Set the resulting HTML at the control level
       </li>
<li>
        Set the CSS property
       </li>
<li>
        Set the title property of the HTML page
       </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2>
<a name="RichTexbox">
</a>
       Rich Textbox Control
      </h2>
<p>
       We need a textbox control that you can format the internal content. For example
                    we might want to have text display like this:
      </p>
<p>
           This is a
       <b>
        bold
       </b>
       label with
       <i>
        italics
       </i>
       in it too.
      </p>
<p>
       This would be useful for building reports that are used for invoicing or contracts
                    that you use all the time but need to be tailored for a specific contact.

<p>
       We need a parameter type that will enable us to have a list of values (likely from
                    a query) such that you can select multiple values from the list and then use the
                    set of parameter values in your dataset queries or report items. For example, we
                    want to allow our users to report on set of suppliers all at once, rather than one
                    at a time.

<h2>
<a name="TaskList">
</a>
       The Task List is lost on restart of Visual Studio

<p>
       The task list is a handy feature built into Visual Studio. It provides a single
                    point of reference for any user tasks, compile-time warnings and errors found in
                    your reports. In most cases you can double-click the task to jump to the offending
                    line of code or control. For some reason Reporting Services does not retain this
                    list of errors once you close Visual Studio, so you have to copy and paste the errors
                    into notepad, which can be annoying. (Note: this works for items manually created.)
      </p>
<p>
       When the report is first imported there are comments in the .RDL file for each warning;
                    however, after any changes to the reports these disappear. We would like to see
                    this task list retained, so that the developer can check off tasks in the task list
                    as they are done.

                    and run it myself using SQL Server Management Studio. I would also like to be able

       If you create a report with an embedded image and then you delete that image, it
                    remains in the xml report definition, therefore unnecessarily increasing report
                    size. To get rid of the image, you need to either:
      </p>
<ul>
<li>
        Manually delete &lt;EmbeddedImages&gt;&lt;/EmbeddedImages&gt; from xml.
       </li>
<li>
        Understand that you deleting the image control – there is a 1:many relationship
                        between embedded images and image controls (you can reuse images in multiple places
                        on the report). To delete an embedded image, select “Report” –
                        “Embedded Images”.
       </li>
</ul>
<p>
       What should happen is - when you delete an image control it asks:
      </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>
         "Would you also like to delete the embedded image?"
        </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
         Yes / No

       When we use images in our reports we like to make a separate project to deploy the

<p>
       The problem is that during design time, despite the images still being correctly
                    in the relative path to the .rdl files, they don't show up in the designer. Understandably
                    the relative path won't necessarily be correct for the deployed version to work,
                    but if the path is valid then the image should show.

       Parameters - When you add a Parameter it should automatically add a label to the designer

       Too many developers forget to add their parameters to the design of a report. Then
                    when the user exports it to say a .pdf, they see the report, but they dont know
                    the parameters that gave the data they are looking at.
      </p>
<p>
       When a parameter is added to a report, the labels should be automatically added that
                    display the parameters being used on the report.

       When a parameter is displayed (especially when using combo boxes and multi select

                    from the combo.

       Auto-sizing columns

       When you preview your report, sometimes it can take some time, switching back and
                    forth between layout and preview modes, in order to get the column widths the right
                    size to allow prevent your report from looking ugly. For this reason, there should
                    be some functionality added to help overcome this problem.
      </p>
<p>
       A few implementation suggestions are:
      </p>
</li>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
        In design view there could be a smart task on the table/matrix that executes the
                        data and works out an intelligent width.
       </li>
<li>
        You could add a multi-line property,
                            to the cells of a table/matrix, that defaults to true. When it is set to false it
                            could force the data to be on one line, and not wrap down to another line, forcing
                            the column to widen to accommodate the single line of data.
       </li>
<li>
        In preview view there could be the ability to resize the columns (as you are seeing
                        the data) and when you switch back to design view, you could have a messagebox asking
                        if they would like to save the changed column widths - this would be like an Access
                        datasheet.

</ul>
</blockquote>

<a name="RecursiveData">

<p>
       We suggest showing the Employees and Managers in Adventure Works, as managers are
                    employees too and can also have their own managers. This should be shown using padding
                    to achieve the visual nesting.

      </p>
<p>
       This functionality would make it easier to work with XML data that contains multiple

       The fix is to remove the "User!UserID" from the footer to enable subscriptions.
                        In Reporting Services 2005, they have improved this - normal subscription is enabled,
                        but Data-driven subscription is still disabled in this case. The behaviour should
                        allow the report to work and a different value entered for UserID eg."N/A"

                        email at a preset time. After you receive the email, if you want RS to resend the
                        report, you have to wait until the subscription is triggered again.
      </p>
<p>
       Add a trigger in the report subscription email will make the Reporting Services

<h2>
       Improve compatibility for Firefox
      </h2>
      Reporting Services Reports (2005) makes beautiful reports, well it does in IE, but
                    the HTML is not good for some non-IE browsers (aka Firefox). Reports are displayed
                    in an IFRAME that's deep in nested table land, and the IFRAME's height setting only
                    works in IE. This cause reports can't display correctly - the IFRAME's height defaults
                    to a few hundred pixels, so you only see the top 2 inches of the report. Like this:
      <p>
<img height="576" src="/archive/standards/better-software-suggestions/images/rsin-firefox.jpg" width="571"/>
<br/>
       Figure: Reporting services report in Firefox looks terrible
      </p>
<p>
       Workaround: though we can fix it by adding a min-height into ReportingServices.css
                        file (it's found in "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.3\Reporting Services\ReportManager\Styles\"
                        by default):
      </p>
<div class="greyBox">
<p>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 0);">
         /* Fix report IFRAME height for Firefox */
        </span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);">
         .DocMapAndReportFrame
         <br/>
</span>
        {
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
<br/>
             min-height
        </span>
        :
        <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">
         860px
        </span>
        ;
        <br/>
        }
       </p>
</div>
<br/>
      But the report still can't display in correct width even if you added a min-width
                        element, like this:
      <p>
<img height="714" src="/archive/standards/better-software-suggestions/images/rsin-firefox-2.gif" width="816"/>
<br/>
       Figure: Reporting services report in Firefox still looks terrible after fixed height
                            problem

<p>
       This problem still has not been fixed in SQL Server Reporting Services 2008.
