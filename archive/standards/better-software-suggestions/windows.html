              <h2>Restart Computer prompts after Automatic Updates</h2>
              <p>
                When an automatic update has been installed, I am prompted to
                restart my computer for the updates to take effect. In the
                circumstance of choosing 'Restart Later', the automatic update
                initally accepts this but within a short period of time it asks
                me again. It will continue to ask me until I have chosen
                'Restart Now' or when the update automatically restarts my
                computer after the timer has run out. This has led to loss of
                valuable information and work in the past. Automatic Updates
                should run so that once I have chosen not to restart my
                computer, the update should accept my first response and not
                repeatedly ask me. Also, if I choose to ignore this prompt, the
                update should not automatically restart my computer after the
                timer has run out.

              <h2>Add/Remove Programs Sort By Date</h2>
              <p>
                I frequently find it necessary to install new software. On
                occasion, something will go wrong and I need to uninstall some
                programs in an attempt to fix the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                It would be extremely useful to be able to sort the list of
                installed programs by the date of installation. This way, I
                would save time by having all the most recently installed
                programs at the top of the list.
              </p>
              <p>
                It would make sense to have column headings for the various
                properties, then you could sort by any of them in the same way
                you can sort listed items in Windows explorer.

              <h2>Window Popping Up And Taking The Focus</h2>
              <p>
                I think that a window should NEVER be allowed to take the focus
                if you are typing (have typed something in the prior 2 seconds).
              </p>
              <p>
                Eg. While I am typing an email this window pops up and takes the
                focus. This is INCREDIBLY frustrating.

                Users of Internet Explorer may be familiar with the keystroke,
                CTRL+N, which opens a new browser window. While Windows Explorer
                shares many of the conveniences of Internet Explorer,

              <p>
                The list box on the File Types tab of the Folder Options dialog
                (Start &gt; Control Panel; Folder Options) lists all of the
                current file associations on the system. (See screenshot below.)
                As a result we will almost inevitably be faced with many
                thousands of items in a single list box.
              </p>
              <p>This is a bad idea for two reasons:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  It is difficult for users to find what they're looking for.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The list takes a long time to load; the user may be forced to
                  wait for as long as 30 seconds before being able to interact
                  with the dialog box.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                A better idea may be to add a filter text box. Then the list can
                be filtered according to the characters entered into the text
                box, and updated each time the filter text changes.

                Scheduled Windows Tasks require passwords. However, like all

                I don't mind updating the passwords (although automatic updating
                would make a lot of sense) - however as a minimum Windows should
                email me if the Scheduled Task fails (meaning I need a place to
                add an email address).

                eg. The highlighted one (jusched) would take us to a website

                In particular - a traverse of a directory (e.g. a user clicked
                on a folder to open it) should be easily distinguisable from a
                read by another program. At present, you cannot differentiate
                between you opening a folder (through explorer.exe) and another
                application opening a folder or file. If you open a folder,
                there could be 20 or so events recorded in the event log -
                mostly "ReadData" events - and these could be by several
                applications. Ideally, if I open a folder and then execute a
                file, I should only see 2 user-related events in the log - 1
                open and one execute.

                it worked well as we moved to Windows 98 ... And then it
