       While your driving along,

      <p>
       I've found installed a laptop mount into the passenger side 
					of my middle console that will secure my laptop in place 
					while I'm busy driving. The system was relatively simplistic 
					to install (6 self-tapping screws into the carpet and base 
					of the passenger side floor) and its convenient to use 
					because of its full swivel capabilities. It can also be 
					easily removed when a passenger wants to get their seat 
					back.

      <p>
       Forget about all the practicalities of a small car, sure they're easier to park, safer to 
					manoeuvre,
					and extremely good looking on the road (particularly a certain '87 Red Nissan Pulsar hatch) but my
					advice is go for the Big Mama of a car. They are far better when it comes to moving people and they
					can fit much more advertising down the side of them.

       Do you have a garbage bin?
      </h2>
      <p>
       If your one of those people who simply can't resist making a mess of their own property,
					then stop! If I don't have a proper place to throw my 
					rubbish then its straight to the passenger seat floor (at least I'm not sitting in it!) to deal with later. 
					But it's not appealing to anyone who else who has to sit in the mess, and its
					useless when it comes to picking up the ladies.
      </p>
      <p>
       My suggestion is to pick up a handy car garbage bag. They velcro round the head rest of the car seat
					and will help you make that very untidy, cluttered mess into the perfect, structured mess that we all
					strive towards.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can get one of these cheap car garbage bags for about $10 at your local K-Mart in the auto section.

       The boot (or trunk for our American friends) is another one of those places that quickly turns to chaos without
					a proper management system.
      </p>
      <p>
       My suggestion is to quickly measure up your boot and then go to your 
					local K-Mart (or Wal-Mart for our American 
					friends) and get some plastic boxes or trays (as long as 
					they are open ended or clear) and stack them into your boot. You can then use these 
					to structure your mess much better...

      <p>
       I love a gizmo... And I hate doing something slowly when I 
					know that it can be completed more quickly. Reading street 
					maps and potentially getting lost is one such example. We 
					recommend that you purchase a removable GPS unit, and use it 
					conjunction with your PDA or new
       <a href="/ssw/Redirect/XDAPhone.htm">
        XDA II SmartPhone

       <a href="/ssw/Redirect/Navman.htm">
        NavMan
       </a>
       . The GPS unit works with 
			the XDA over Bluetooth so that your system works when you jump in 
			the car without having to play with cables. The package worked out 
			at about AU$900.

       Do you keep a Jerry Can full of fuel?
      </h2>
      <p>
       There have been countless times where I've tried
					to push the limit of my fuel tank just that bit too far. 
					Here is some very practical advice learnt from numerous 
					mistakes - keep a jerry can full of petrol in the back of 
					the car so that when disaster strikes you won't be walking 
					for half an hour to the petrol station. Or worse yet, making 
					an embarrassing call to roadside assistance and having to 
					fess up to your womanly ways... Also if you happen to see a 
			stranded person on the side of the highway you can always earn some 
			Karma back by helping out the poor soul.

      <p>
       A hands-free device of some kind for your phone is not only legally necessary but very handy. 
					I love it when you walk down the street and can creep people 
					out as you seemingly talk to yourself in an obnoxiously loud 
					voice into a discretely positioned mobile phone headset. 
					There's nothing more rewarding then knowing that someone 
					dislikes you already without even getting to know you yet.

       In this day and age there's no point learning how to judge distance while reversing... Thanks to the 
					many uncoordinated female and elderly drivers, there is now 
					accurate, easy to install parking sensors that can be 
					installed into almost any car. It's lovely, gone are the 
					days of nudge parking! Now I get two beeps when I get close, 
					and a continuous irritating beep get really close... too 
					easy!

       Do you drink water instead of Coke?

      <p>
       This ones kind of obvious, but it really is a good idea ok! I recommend that you keep a bottle of water 
					at all times so that hopefully in the long term you'll save 
					a bit of money on those dental bills...

      <p>
       While your in the car you have the perfect opportunity to catch up on all your phone calls. 
					I like to have my personal assistants (my life is a bit of a 
					shambles but I'm happy) write up a list of all the phone 
					calls that need to be made. This list automatically gets 
					synchronised out of my Tasks from Outlook onto my XDA. When 
					I'm ready I go through my list and catch up on all the 
					critical calls.

       Do you eat enough fruit?
      </h2>
      <p>
       Whenever I used to stop at the petrol station, I'd walk in 
				the door and struggle to walk past that massive totem pole like 
				structure that they pack with chocolate right next to the 
				cashier. It'd take every ounce of restraint to not try the new 
				Cadbury chocolate bar... But now a simple solution - I always 
				fill up on fruit instead. It's much healthier, contains the 
				sugar hit so dearly needed, and its a lot cheaper.
      </p>
      <p>
       To stow the fruit I installed the newly developed SSW Fruit 
				Keeper &copy;. It basically consists of rows of thick plastic 
				strips being stuck down to the dash to limit the movement of the 
				fruit as you go round corners, etc.

       The plastic material is available from any good hardware shop
