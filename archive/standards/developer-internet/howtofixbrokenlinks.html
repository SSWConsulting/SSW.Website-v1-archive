          Broken links not are not only a bug in the web site, but may damage
          the company's professional image.
          <br />
          <br />
          We have developed a strategy to reduce and possibly eliminate every
          broken links on a web site. Currently we use
          <a href="/ssw/LinkAuditor"> SSW Link Auditor </a>
          to scan our site for broken links.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many webmasters work with sites that have grown large over time and
          have consequently become difficult to maintain. They fix problems as
          customer report bugs. A better approach is to use a utility that will
          analyze your whole site and report any problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          One such utility is SSW Link Auditor. Give it the URL and after a few
          minutes you have a full analysis of any problems. We worry about
          broken links (dead URLs) and broken anchors. We recommend that you use
          a utility like SSW Link Auditor on a fortnightly basis and have a
          quick look at the report it produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The command line version of this utility can be scheduled to run using
          Windows Task Scheduler, and automatically generate the report on the
          file system.
        </p>
        <p>
          A site with more than 3000 links takes approximately 3 minutes to
          check. You can constantly find dead links and site errors before your
          potential customers do!

          (recommended) to open the report in Internet Explorer. The report is
          saved as C:\Program Files\SSW Link Auditor\LastReport.xml by default,
          although you can specify a different path on the How to Scan page of
          the wizard.

        <p>
          In Windows Task Scheduler (Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories
          -&gt;System Tools -&gt; Scheduled Tasks):
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a task</li>
          <li>
            Locate the Link Auditor Console executable (typically "C:\Program
            Files\SSW Link Auditor\LinkAuditorConsole.exe")
          </li>
          <li>
            Append arguments "[the URL to scan] [report file path] -beyond
            +fragments +fswf" to the end of the execution path

        <h2>Which problems will you fix?</h2>
        <p>
          The right column of the report describes the error that LinkAuditor
          encountered when trying to load the page. Underneath each entry is a
          list of pages which contain the broken link. We want to fix all of
          the:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>NotFound (404 errors)</li>
          <li>AccessDenied (403 errors)</li>
          <li>FragmentMissing</li>
          <li>FragmentDuplicated</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tips on fixing typical errors</h2>
        <p>
          With external links that are no longer valid, comment out the links
          like this. e.g.
        </p>
        <p>
          &lt;!--JL 11/03/2002, url doesn't exist &lt;A
          href=http://www.invalid.url&gt; --&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a possibility to link that come up again if the Web Server is
          down. Remember to always date the comment so that you can permanently
          delete it if it has been down for a while.
        </p>
        <b> Product Documentation </b>
        <br />
        <!--You will find many links such as "HTTP://localhost/..." in product doco 
	    that are designed for off-line viewing. These should be left as they are.-->
        <p>
          Don't forget to synchronize your local copy of the web site with the
          production server! It's a very easy mistake to make so I suggest that
          you keep
          <a
            href="/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/WebdevelopmentTools.aspx#FtpSync"
          >
            FtpSync
          </a>
          open the whole time and
          <b> synchronize the current directory every time you edit a file </b>
          .
        </p>
        <h2>Finishing up</h2>
        <p>
          Please make sure that the site is completely synchronised and all ZZed
          files are deleted from the production server. Run Link Auditor again
          and create the report to prove that you have fixed all broken links
          properly. Then you need to decide who will do this task next month.
          Please do this according to alphabetical order on surname. You may
          consider skipping staff members who are overloaded or working on
          important client tasks. Then send the URL of your report to the staff
          member assigned to deal with this task next month (and CC your
          supervisor). Remind them to run Link Auditor again just prior to
          fixing the site.
        </p>
