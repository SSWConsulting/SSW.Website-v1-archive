                    Software must help business become more efficient and build
                    better relationships with their Clients. This means that
                    software must also be cost-effective and quick to market.
                    Traditionally, software has been slow to build and difficult
                    to change.

                    first, and respond quickly to a changing commercial

                                from getting bogged down in future details
                                before you have to. This way, we always keep

                        start at a very high level, and then drill down into the
                        highest priorities (set by the Client) first. SSW and
                        the Client together write "Client Stories".

                                Would like an automated method of transferring

                                FedEx. This would save filling out the forms and
                                faxing the information by the accounts staff

                    A Client Story is not a technical document, but rather a
                    simple, 3 sentence explanation in an email of what the
                    Client needs the system to do for them. The purpose of the
                    story is to get an estimate of how long that story will take
                    to design and implement. A Client story, where possible, is
                    turned into a mockup form or a series of mockup forms, which
                    give the look and feel of the application.

                    <p>
                      If a story is going to take more then three days it will
                      be cut down so it becomes 1 to 3 days. If the Client
                      requests "A system to manage customers", this will take
                      longer then 3 days. So we break the work down into the
                      smallest units possible. In this case the above request to
                      "manage customers" may be broken down into
                      "add/edit/delete customers" and "searching customers."

                      At SSW instead of using cards we manage our releases using
                      emails. The emails pertaining to a release are stored in a
                      public folder - each folder will usually contain about 2
                      weeks worth of development work.

                      A Release Plan covers tasks that will be performed over 1
                      - 3 week period. It lists what functionality will be
                      delivered, and the time and cost estimates associated with
                      those tasks. Each Release Plan is treated as a separate
                      proposal and must be signed off after review by the
                      Client.

                      1 - 3 weeks means that priorities must be agreed, so that
                      the core components of the software are delivered first.

                      <p>
                        A Mini Release is a technical description of the Release
                        Plan, broken down into 1 - 3 day programming tasks.
                        Remember, the Release Plan is a series of functional
                        requirements in an order agreed upon by the Client and
                        SSW. These tasks are broken down into Testing and
                        Development, in that order!

                      According to XP, Tests are written before Development
                      takes place. This means that ALL development that occurs
                      must run according to the rules set down. This is an
                      efficient way of catching and fixing bugs in code.

                    <p>
                      The idea here is to plan a set of unit tests that you can
                      run each time you add functionality to an application.
                      This is a great way to ensure that you haven't 'broken'
                      any of your existing functionality when you add new
                      features - if all the tests still pass then you know
                      you're in the clear!

                              Pair Programming is two developers sitting
                              side-by-side, working together on the same design,
                              function or form (on the one PC). Software is
                              complex and the benefits of working together are:
                              <br />
                              * Less time stuck on a problem - you have someone
                              familiar with the project to help you work through
                              the problem
                              <br />
                              * Your code with have less a strange workarounds -
                              because if something doesn't add up to a
                              developer, he has someone to ask
                              <br />
                              * Cleaner code - because you know someone else is
                              going to be looking at your code
                              <br />
                              * Support - when you need changes down the track,
                              you have 2 people to call on
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              Not if we use that definition. At SSW we have our
                              own version of Pair Programming. We work in 2's
                              but each developer has a PC and they sit right
                              next to each other. We do this because we get the
                              benefits of 2, but have a lower cost overhead.

                            <p>
                              Some projects are done quicker with 2 people -
                              especially when they are complex. But on most
                              projects there is an overhead, because of the
                              extra communication between the developers - you
                              now have to please someone else - not just
                              yourself.
                              <br />
                              We generally estimate the overhead as 20% extra.
                              But this is more than offset by the cleaner code
                              and better solutions that come from two brains
                              working together.

                      The Development Tasks are the names of all the Forms,
                      Functions, Objects, Stored Procedures that will be used in
                      the next 1 - 3 days development. Once the tasks have been
                      agreed, the tests are written and development commences.
                      Progress is reviewed at the end of every Mini Release. SSW
                      prefers to write most production code using our own
                      version of Pair Programming. SSW manages projects and

                      At the end of the Release Plan schedule (1 - 3 weeks) SSW
                      releases a version of the software to the Client for
                      review. The Client reviews the delivered version against
                      the Client Stories created at the first step. Where
                      deficiencies arise, they are fixed before future

                      the project was on a fixed-price basis the 30 day warranty
                      commences. At the end of 30 days the application is signed

                      In many instances new applications are built according to
                      the direction of management, and the users are the last
                      ones to actually check out the new system. SSW XPDM traps
                      this at the very beginning, bringing the real business
                      staff into the design process. On top of this, SSW
                      technical staff work directly with your business users to
                      demonstrate and implement the software.

                  <p>
                    SSW XPDM is about minimising risk and maximising benefit.
                    There is no doubt that Software Development is still an
                    inexact science with a whole gamut of risks and benefits.
                    SSW XPDM ensures that risk is minimised to only a 1 - 3 week
                    period. If either the Client or SSW is completely way off
                    reality after the first Release Plan, it is captured
                    quickly, and design and development can be adjusted
                    accordingly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    SSW XPDM maximises the good things about Software
                    Development (such as reviewing code, and getting feedback).
                    Through this, we hope, better software applications are
                    delivered.

                  <h2>OK, you've sold me - What's the cost?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Following SSW XPDM requires a high level of commitment from
                    both the Client and SSW. The Client becomes an essential
                    ingredient thoughout the project. This means that we need
                    your time, to design and review, regularly, and we'll
                    probably be working alongside you for most of the project.
