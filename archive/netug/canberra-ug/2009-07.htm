<li>60 mins - What Just Happened to Silverlight &amp; Expression! by 
	<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msmossyblog/">Scott Barnes</a><br/>
	Silverlight &amp; Expression 3 launch is an important moment in Microsoft's timeline, as this is our V3 moment!. 
    In light of this point in time, Scott has vowed to ensure all within his beloved home, Australia, get a deep 
    insight into what just happened in both Silverlight and Expression 3. Not only will Scott cover off some of the 
    new stuff, but will highlight some of the existing brilliance within these products through examples and 
    commentary of how the old and new features came to be (as well as hints to both products' future).<br/>
                
    In this session you not only will hear all of this, but this is also a perfect opportunity to lobby for what 
    you want to see in Silverlight &amp; Expression 4! - Yes, not only did we just finish work on 3, but we're keen to 
    get started on the next version - given Scott's team is on the planning team, this is a great opportunity for 
    you to influence the future of Microsoft's UX Platform.
	<br/>
	Scott is a Rich Platforms Product Manager for the UX Platform Team (Silverlight, WPF, Expression, ASP.NET etc).<br/>
    He has been working with Microsoft/Adobe/Macromedia technology for the past 10 years with a main focus specifically 
    on Internet Applications (aka. RIA, Rich Client Technology etc). <br/>
    Scott first started out as a UX developer in the late 90’s and over the years developed a passion for programmatic art 
    (Designer + Developer mind). He recently has branched out further into 3D modelling, animation and XNA game development 
    making full use of both his designer + developer mindset.</li><br/>
